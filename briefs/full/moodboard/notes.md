# Moodboard Notes — NuRange

## Logo Style
Clean geometric wordmark or abstract symbol suggesting movement, flow, or a signal/pulse. No literal trucks or arrows. Think: the logo of a fintech that does logistics.

## Graphic Style
Minimal. Data-forward but warm. Subtle gradients or grid systems. Not flashy — precise.

## Typography
Modern sans-serif — could lean technical (Suisse, Neue Haas Grotesk) or slightly humanist (Söhne, Inter). Should feel like a well-designed SaaS product, not a startup template.

## Color Mood
Deep navy or charcoal as primary. One confident accent — electric blue, teal, or amber. White space is the hero.
