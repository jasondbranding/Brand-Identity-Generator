# Brand Brief — NuRange

## Brand Name
NuRange

## Product
A B2B SaaS platform that helps logistics and supply chain teams track shipments, predict delivery delays using AI, and communicate proactively with end customers — all from a single dashboard.

## Target Audience
Operations managers and supply chain leads at mid-market e-commerce companies (50–500 employees). Technically literate but not engineers. They are overwhelmed by fragmented tools, frustrated by reactive firefighting, and desperate for predictability.

## Tone
Confident, calm, intelligent. Not corporate — human. Like a sharp ops person who always has the answer before you ask. Reassuring but never boring.

## Core Promise
"You'll always know before your customers do."

## Competitors
FedEx Logistics, Project44, Flexport — all heavy, enterprise-feeling, dashboard-overloaded.

## What makes NuRange different
Radical simplicity. One screen. AI-powered, not AI-buzzworded. Feels like Notion met Stripe and decided to solve logistics.
