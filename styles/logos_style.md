# Brand Identity Style Guide

This document outlines the core visual language for logos and complementary patterns, derived from the analysis of a high-quality logo collection. It is designed to guide AI image generation towards a consistent, professional, and scalable aesthetic.

## For LOGOS:

### 1. Form Language

*   **Dominant Forms**: Prioritize `symbol` and `abstract` forms. Primary shapes include perfect circles, rounded rectangles/squares, ellipses, and smooth, continuous organic curves.
*   **Geometry Rules**:
    *   All rectilinear shapes must incorporate `rounded corners` with a consistent radius, typically ranging from 10-25% of the shortest side dimension (e.g., 20% of the height for a rounded square).
    *   Curves must be smooth, deliberate, and geometrically defined, often based on circular arcs or Bezier curves with minimal anchor points.
    *   Forms frequently utilize `implied circular construction` or are contained within a clear circular or rounded rectangular bounding box.
*   **Construction Principles**:
    *   Strong reliance on `negative space` to define internal features or secondary forms. The positive and negative spaces should be equally considered and balanced.
    *   Employ `symmetry` (radial or bilateral) for balance and stability, or `asymmetry` with careful visual weighting for dynamic compositions.
    *   Forms should appear as if constructed on a precise `grid system`, ensuring perfect alignment, consistent spacing, and harmonious proportions.
    *   `Counter forms` are critical and should actively contribute to the legibility and character of the design.

### 2. Style Constraints

*   **Rendering Style**: Strictly `minimal`, `flat`, and two-dimensional vector graphics.
*   **Fill vs Outline**: Exclusively use `solid filled shapes`. Outlines are not permitted as primary structural elements; they only define the perimeter of filled forms. No stroke-based logos.
*   **Complexity Level**: `Minimalist`. Logos should consist of a maximum of 2-3 distinct, simplified geometric or organic shapes. Avoid intricate details, fine lines, or overly complex compositions.

### 3. Technical Specs

*   **Stroke Weights**: Not applicable for primary filled forms. For elements defined by negative space or internal cuts, the implied 'stroke' or gap width must maintain a consistent visual weight, typically no less than 10% of the logo's smallest dimension to ensure legibility at scale.
*   **Proportions**: Adhere to simple, harmonious geometric ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:1.618, 1:2) within elements and the overall composition. Ensure all elements are visually balanced relative to each other.
*   **Spacing**: Maintain generous and consistent internal spacing (negative space) between all active elements. This spacing should be proportional, typically 1x the effective 'stroke' width of negative space elements.
*   **Scalability**: Designs must be inherently scalable to extreme sizes. Forms and negative space must remain clear and distinct at very small sizes (e.g., 16x16px) without loss of integrity or detail.

### 4. Composition

*   **Centering**: The primary visual mass of the logo should be optically centered within its display canvas, often within a square or circular implied bounding box.
*   **Padding**: A minimum clear space around the logo equivalent to 1x the height of its primary element, or 25% of the logo's overall height/width (whichever is greater), must be maintained.
*   **Figure-Ground Ratio**: Emphasize a strong, unambiguous figure-ground relationship with a clear distinction between positive and negative space. Dominant elements should be clearly defined against their background.
*   **Colors**: Utilize `high-contrast` color combinations, frequently `monochrome` (single color on contrasting background) or duotone. When using multiple colors, ensure clear separation and high legibility. Dominant background colors may be `dark` or light, with the logo in a contrasting color.

### 5. Avoid (LOGOS)

*   Complex gradients, photographic elements, or raster textures.
*   Thin, inconsistent, or decorative stroke weights for outlines.
*   Sharp, acute angles, pointed corners, or harsh, abrupt edges.
*   Excessive detail, ornamentation, or multiple competing visual elements.
*   Low contrast color palettes or ambiguous figure-ground relationships.
*   3D rendering, bevels, embosses, drop shadows, or light source effects.
*   Skeuomorphism or realistic depictions of objects.
*   Overlapping elements without clear hierarchy or strong negative space interaction.

## For PATTERNS:

### 1. Motif Rules

*   **Dominant Motif Types**: Patterns must be constructed from single, simple, abstracted geometric shapes or stylized symbols. These motifs should be directly derived from the core visual vocabulary of the associated logos (e.g., rounded rectangles, circles, organic blobs, specific counter forms or fragmented logo elements).
*   **Geometric Principles**: Motifs must adhere to the same principles of smooth curves, consistent rounded corner radii, and planar, two-dimensional rendering as the logos.

### 2. Grid System

*   **Tiling Method**: Employ a strict, repetitive geometric grid system for motif placement (e.g., square grid, staggered brick, hexagonal grid, diagonal grid).
*   **Spacing**: Maintain consistent and equal spacing between repeating motifs, horizontally and vertically. The clear space between motifs should typically be 0.5x to 1x the motif's average dimension.
*   **Density**: Patterns should exhibit a balanced density, allowing sufficient negative space to prevent visual clutter. Moderate to sparse motif density is preferred over high density.

### 3. Style Constraints

*   **Rendering**: Flat, solid color fills for all motifs. No gradients, shadows, textures, or intricate details within individual motifs.
*   **Color Usage**: Strictly `monochrome` or `high-contrast duotone` palettes. A single dominant motif color against a contrasting background, or two contrasting colors for different motif types, is preferred. Colors should align with the high-contrast principle.
*   **Complexity**: `Minimalist`. Patterns should be easily readable and recognizable, even at a distance, composed of simple, distinct repeating units.

### 4. Tiling Technical

*   **Edge Alignment**: Motifs must align perfectly at the tile edges to ensure seamless, infinite repetition across any surface without visual breaks.
*   **Seamless Requirements**: The pattern must be designed for infinite tiling in all directions, creating a continuous, unbroken visual flow.

### 5. Avoid (PATTERNS)

*   Non-repeating or irregularly spaced motifs.
*   Photographic elements, complex illustrations, or highly detailed motifs.
*   Complex, multi-color palettes (more than two dominant colors) or gradients within motifs.
*   Inconsistent motif styles, varying sizes, or inconsistent rotation within a single pattern.
*   Patterns that do not tile seamlessly or show visible seams at repetition points.
*   Overly dense or visually cluttered arrangements that obscure individual motifs or the overall structure.
*   3D effects, shadows, or reflections applied to motifs.
