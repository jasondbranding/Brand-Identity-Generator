### For LOGOS:

#### 1. Form Language
- **Dominant Forms**: Prioritize combination marks (68%), pairing a distinctive symbol with a refined wordmark. Wordmarks (24%) and monoline emblems (4%) are secondary but important forms.
- **Geometric Construction**: Forms should exhibit a balance between structured geometry and organic fluidity. Curved elements should be smooth and consistent, often derived from circular or elliptical arcs. Straight lines should be precise. Interlocking or intertwined forms, often based on stylized letterforms or abstract shapes, are preferred for symbols.
- **Shape Characteristics**: Rounded corners and soft terminals are frequently observed, even in serifs, contributing to an elegant and approachable feel. Embrace symmetrical compositions within symbols. Negative space is an integral part of the form, defining internal shapes and providing visual breathing room.
- **Letterform Influence**: For wordmarks, classic serif typography with high stroke contrast (thin-to-thick ratio typically 1:3 to 1:5) is dominant. Sans-serifs, if used, should be elegant, humanist, or geometric with generous spacing. Initial letters are often stylized or form the basis of abstract symbols.
- **Avoid**: Angular, sharp, or excessively geometric forms that lack softness or flow. Avoid forms that appear fragmented, unbalanced, or lacking a clear underlying geometric or organic structure. Avoid overly complex forms that lose legibility at small scales.

#### 2. Style Constraints
- **Rendering Style**: Logos must be rendered as clean, flat 2D vector graphics. Solid fills and consistent monoline outlines are the primary rendering techniques. Surface textures on the logo elements themselves are generally avoided, though subtle, sophisticated background textures (e.g., fine grain, leather texture) are permissible to enhance the overall presentation, not as part of the logo's intrinsic design.
- **Fill vs. Outline**: Both solid fills and monoline outlines are valid. When using outlines, stroke weight must be uniform throughout the entire outlined element. When using solid fills, maintain crisp edges and a unified color. Combination logos may use a solid symbol with an outlined wordmark, or vice-versa, provided consistency is maintained.
- **Complexity Level**: Aim for sophisticated simplicity. Logos should be moderately intricate in detail (e.g., intricate monoline patterns, detailed serifs) but maintain overall clarity and avoid visual clutter. The design should feel intentional and refined, not overly simplistic or elementary.
- **Color Usage**: Logos should be presented in a single, solid color or a duotone palette with high contrast against the background. Preferred colors are muted, rich, or sophisticated (e.g., deep earth tones, elegant neutrals, precious metals, deep jewel tones). Color variation should be minimal, focusing on tonal harmony.
- **Avoid**: Gradients, drop shadows, bevels, embossing, or other 3D rendering techniques directly applied to the logo elements. Avoid photographic or rasterized elements within the logo. Avoid overly bright, neon, or primary color palettes for the logo itself. Avoid grunge, distressed, or intentionally imperfect aesthetics.

#### 3. Technical Specs
- **Stroke Weights**: For monoline logos, use a consistent stroke weight that is proportionate to the overall logo size, typically between 1% and 2% of the logo's bounding box height. For serif wordmarks, maintain high stroke contrast with elegant hairlines. All strokes must be vector-defined.
- **Proportions**: Logos should typically fit within a square or golden ratio bounding box for symbols, ensuring visual balance. Wordmarks are horizontally oriented with an aspect ratio typically between 3:1 and 6:1 (width:height). Ensure the symbol-to-wordmark ratio in combination logos maintains visual harmony, often with the symbol being 1x-1.5x the x-height of the wordmark.
- **Spacing (Kerning & Tracking)**: Typography requires precise kerning for optimal legibility and aesthetic appeal. Tracking should be open, particularly for uppercase wordmarks, to convey a premium and spacious feel. Letter spacing between capital letters should be visually balanced, typically ranging from 0.05em to 0.15em.
- **Spacing (Element Separation)**: Clear and consistent spacing between separate elements (e.g., symbol and wordmark in a combination logo) is critical. This spacing should be proportional to the logo elements, often based on the x-height or a specific unit of measure derived from the logo's geometry.
- **Scalability**: All logo elements must be designed for infinite scalability, functioning perfectly from favicon size (e.g., 16x16px) to large-scale signage without loss of detail or integrity. Vector paths must be optimized for clean rendering at all scales.
- **Avoid**: Inconsistent stroke weights within a monoline structure. Poor kerning or cramped letter spacing. Disproportionate element sizes or awkward overall dimensions. Rasterized elements that degrade upon scaling.

#### 4. Composition
- **Centering**: Logos should be centrally aligned both horizontally and vertically within their designated clear space or canvas. In combination marks, the wordmark should be centrally aligned beneath the symbol, or perfectly aligned to a shared baseline/centerline.
- **Padding/Clear Space**: A generous clear space must surround the logo, free from any other graphic elements. The minimum clear space should be at least 1/3 of the logo's height (or width, whichever is smaller) on all sides, ensuring the logo has ample breathing room and impact.
- **Figure-Ground Ratio**: The logo should occupy approximately 15-30% of the overall canvas area, ensuring sufficient clear space. A strong figure-ground relationship is essential, with high visual contrast between the logo and its immediate background for maximum legibility and presence.
- **Avoid**: Off-center or unbalanced compositions. Insufficient clear space that crowds the logo. Low contrast between the logo and its background, hindering readability. Cluttered layouts with competing visual elements.

#### 5. Avoid (LOGOS)
- Gradients, drop shadows, glows, bevels, or any simulated 3D effects.
- Overly illustrative, cartoonish, or highly literal imagery.
- Stock photography or raster images as core logo elements.
- Multiple competing fonts or excessive typographic variations.
- Jagged lines, unrefined curves, or asymmetrical forms without intentional design purpose.
- Bright, neon, or primary color palettes.
- Textures applied directly to the logo form (subtle background textures are permissible).
- Comic Sans, Papyrus, or similar low-quality/overused typefaces.
- Overly thin or overly thick stroke weights that compromise legibility at various scales.

### For PATTERNS:

#### 1. Motif Rules
- **Dominant Motif Types**: Motifs should be abstract, geometric, or highly stylized organic forms, often derived from key elements or the overall aesthetic of the brand's logo. Preferred motifs include interlocking shapes, stylized monograms, linear forms, subtle curvilinear patterns, or abstract interpretations of natural elements.
- **Geometric Principles**: Motifs should be constructed with precision, often based on a hidden grid, and exhibit symmetry (rotational, bilateral, or translational) and harmonious proportions. Curves should be smooth and consistent, and lines should be clean and crisp. The overall feeling should be one of order and design integrity.
- **Relationship to Logo**: Patterns should feel like a natural extension of the logo's visual language, sharing similar curves, line weights, or design philosophies.
- **Avoid**: Literal representations of objects or figures. Highly detailed, photographic, or realistic motifs. Abstract forms that appear random, chaotic, or lack discernible geometric structure. Motifs that are overly childish, aggressive, or overtly technological in style.

#### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact
- **Emotional Impact**: Patterns should evoke feelings of sophistication, refinement, luxury, heritage, calmness, and exclusivity. They should convey a sense of understated elegance and timelessness.
- **Psychological Brand Energy**: The patterns should project an image of established quality, meticulous craftsmanship, quiet confidence, and discerning taste. They should feel premium and aspirational without being ostentatious.
- **Vibe**: The overall vibe should be one of serene luxury, quiet opulence, and a sense of enduring value. It should be invitingly elegant and subtle, rather than loud or attention-seeking.
- **Avoid**: Patterns that are overtly playful, chaotic, busy, aggressive, or cheap-feeling. Avoid designs that evoke anxiety, urgency, or extreme modernity.

#### 3. Grid System
- **Tiling Method**: Patterns must be designed for seamless, continuous tiling across any surface. Common tiling methods include basic repeat (square tile), brick repeat, or half-drop repeat, ensuring a harmonious flow. Rotational symmetry within a repeating unit is encouraged.
- **Spacing**: Generous negative space between individual motifs is crucial to maintain an airy, sophisticated feel. Motifs should not feel cramped. The inter-motif spacing should be visually balanced and consistent across the pattern.
- **Density**: Patterns should be low to medium density. The background color or texture should be prominently visible, allowing the pattern to subtly enhance rather than overwhelm. The overall impression should be spacious and uncluttered. A motif-to-negative-space ratio of approximately 1:3 to 1:5 within the repeating tile is a good guideline.
- **Avoid**: Overly dense patterns that feel claustrophobic or busy. Random scattering of motifs without an underlying grid or logical arrangement. Tiling methods that create awkward visual breaks or abrupt transitions.

#### 4. Style Constraints
- **Rendering**: Patterns should be rendered as flat 2D vector graphics. Motifs can be either solid fills or monoline outlines. As with logos, no gradients, drop shadows, or complex internal textures should be applied to the motifs themselves.
- **Color Usage**: Monochromatic or duotone color schemes are preferred for the pattern elements. Often, the motifs are a subtle tint or shade of the background color, creating a tone-on-tone effect. If contrasting colors are used, they should be muted, sophisticated, and complementary to the overall brand palette. High contrast is acceptable if it enhances elegance and legibility.
- **Complexity**: Individual motifs should be of simple to moderate complexity. The complexity and richness of the pattern arise from the intelligent repetition and arrangement of these simpler elements, not from overly intricate individual motifs.
- **Avoid**: Multi-color palettes within a single pattern instance. Highly saturated or garish color combinations. Photorealistic textures or photographic elements within motifs. Gradients or 3D effects on the motifs.

#### 5. Tiling Technical
- **Edge Alignment**: The pattern must exhibit perfect edge alignment on all four sides of the repeating tile. Motifs crossing the tile boundaries must seamlessly connect to their counterparts on the opposite side, ensuring a continuous visual flow when tiled.
- **Seamless Requirements**: The pattern should be genuinely seamless, meaning there should be no visible lines, breaks, or discontinuities when the tile is repeated infinitely in all directions. The repeat unit itself should be visually undetectable.
- **Vector Integrity**: All pattern elements must be vector-based to ensure infinite scalability without loss of quality or resolution.
- **Avoid**: Visible seams, abrupt cuts, or misalignments at tile boundaries. Patterns that generate unintended visual artifacts or "ghosting" when repeated. Pixelated or rasterized elements that compromise seamlessness.

#### 6. Avoid (PATTERNS)
- Overly busy, cluttered, or chaotic compositions.
- Jagged lines, rough edges, or inconsistent stroke weights within a monoline motif.
- Cartoonish, childish, or overly whimsical motifs.
- Bright, garish, or primary color palettes for the pattern elements.
- Visible grid lines or guides within the final pattern output.
- Textures (e.g., grunge, distressed, glitter) applied directly to the pattern motifs.
- Unintentional gaps or overlaps between repeating elements that break visual continuity.
- Patterns that lack an underlying structure or feel randomly generated.
