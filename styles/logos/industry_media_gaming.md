# Style Guide for AI Image Generation

This document outlines the visual language for generating brand assets, specifically logos and patterns, ensuring consistency with our established style.

## For LOGOS:

### 1. Form Language

-   **Dominant Shapes**: Prioritize geometric forms (circles, squares, triangles, polygons) and their derivatives, frequently softened by rounded corners (radius often 10-25% of the shortest side of the bounding box) and organic curves. Abstract shapes should maintain an underlying geometric or grid-based structure.
-   **Geometry Rules**: Logo construction relies on precise geometric principles. Elements should align to an implied grid system. Angles typically adhere to 45-degree or 90-degree increments where sharp, or smooth, continuous curves. Letterforms, when part of a wordmark or logotype, are custom-modified geometric sans-serifs, often with uniform stroke weights and rounded terminals.
-   **Construction Principles**: Predominantly combination marks (symbol + wordmark). Symbols are either abstract icons, stylized representations, or integrated into typography. Heavy utilization of **counter forms** (negative space within or surrounding elements to define shape) and **negative space** (strategic use of background to create secondary forms or illusions). Elements often exhibit **asymmetry** for dynamism, while maintaining overall visual balance. Modularity implies components can be re-arranged or scaled independently.

### 2. Style Constraints

-   **Rendering Style**: Strictly flat, 2D vector graphics. Emphasize clean lines, sharp or consistently rounded edges, and solid color fields.
-   **Fill vs Outline**: Primarily solid fills for all logo elements. Outline usage is minimal and, if present, should employ a uniform, medium-to-bold stroke weight (e.g., 5-15% of the element's height). No gradients, internal shadows, or complex lighting effects.
-   **Complexity Level**: Minimal to moderate. Logos must be simple, concise, and immediately recognizable. Avoid intricate details that hinder legibility or scalability. Focus on a strong conceptual idea expressed through clear forms.

### 3. Technical Specs

-   **Stroke Weights**: For outlines or implied internal strokes (e.g., separating components), maintain a consistent weight relative to the overall logo size, typically 1/10th to 1/5th of the primary element's thickest point. Internal gaps (counter forms, negative space separations) should be uniform, ranging from 0.1x to 0.3x the thickness of the adjacent primary element.
-   **Proportions**: Symbols often fit within a square or near-square aspect ratio (e.g., 1:1 to 1:1.2). Wordmarks are typically horizontal. The overall logo composition should feel balanced, often leveraging classic design ratios such as the golden ratio or simple integer ratios for harmony.
-   **Spacing**: Generous clear space around the logo elements. Wordmark kerning must be optically balanced for readability and visual density. Spacing between a symbol and its accompanying wordmark should be precise, commonly ranging from 0.5x to 1x the cap height of the wordmark.
-   **Scalability**: Designs must be infinitely scalable without loss of detail or integrity, appearing crisp and clear from a small favicon size to a large billboard.

### 4. Composition

-   **Centering**: Logos are typically optically centered within their display canvas. Combination marks often align the symbol to the left of the wordmark, or centered above it, with clear vertical and horizontal alignment.
-   **Padding**: A minimum clear space of 1x the cap height of the wordmark, or 0.25x the total logo width/height (whichever is greater), must surround the logo to ensure visual isolation.
-   **Figure-Ground Ratio**: Predominantly high-contrast and duo-tone color usage. The logo (figure) must stand out distinctly from its background (ground) with clear boundaries and no ambiguity. Often a single dominant color for the logo against a solid, contrasting background.

### 5. Avoid (Logos)

-   Gradients, textures, drop shadows, bevels, inner shadows, or complex 3D rendering.
-   Photorealistic imagery, intricate illustrations, or rasterized elements.
-   Skewed, distorted, or arbitrarily stretched forms.
-   Multiple competing visual styles or excessive ornamentation within a single logo.
-   Poorly kerned or unrefined typography.
-   Low-contrast color combinations or cluttered palettes (more than 3 distinct colors).
-   Serif typefaces, script fonts, or overly decorative/hand-drawn aesthetics.
-   Thin, delicate lines or intricate details that disappear at small scales.
-   Lack of clear internal structure or conceptual justification for abstract forms.

## For PATTERNS:

### 1. Motif Rules

-   **Dominant Motif Types**: Geometric shapes (e.g., circles, triangles, squares, polygons), often with rounded corners or organically curved edges. Abstract forms derived directly from logo elements or their underlying geometric principles. Interlocking or tessellating shapes. Motifs should heavily feature both positive and negative space in their construction.
-   **Geometric Principles**: Motifs are constructed using precise geometric or organic rules, ensuring repeatability and transformability. Underlying grids are common, but patterns can incorporate subtle **asymmetry** or variations for dynamism. Elements should reflect the **modularity** and **counter forms** seen in the logo collection.

### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact

-   **Emotional Impact**: Modern, dynamic, confident, clean, sophisticated, engaging, and energetic.
-   **Psychological Brand Energy**: Reflects innovation, professionalism, creativity, technological advancement, and a forward-thinking approach.
-   **Vibe**: Contemporary, sleek, bold, and subtly complex through repetition.

### 3. Grid System

-   **Tiling Method**: Emphasize seamless, repeatable grid structures. This can include regular grid layouts (e.g., brick, half-drop, square, hexagonal) or more dynamic, irregular tessellations that maintain perfect edge alignment.
-   **Spacing**: Consistent, intentional spacing between individual motifs, often equal to or greater than the internal spacing within the motifs themselves, to ensure breathability and prevent visual clutter.
-   **Density**: Medium to sparse. Patterns should not feel overwhelming but should provide a discernible visual texture without detracting from primary content. Sufficient negative space around and within motifs is crucial.

### 4. Style Constraints (Patterns)

-   **Rendering**: Flat, 2D vector-like graphics. Solid fills only. No gradients, textures, shadows, or complex lighting.
-   **Color Usage**: Primarily duo-tone or high-contrast, utilizing a limited palette of 1-3 distinct colors. Often a single foreground color for the motifs against a solid, contrasting background. Cool or vibrant color schemes, with high contrast between elements.
-   **Complexity**: Minimalist. Motifs should be simple, iconic forms rather than intricate illustrations. The complexity arises from their arrangement and interaction within the grid, not from individual motif detail.

### 5. Tiling Technical

-   **Edge Alignment**: All motifs and pattern elements must align perfectly at the edges of the tile to ensure seamless repetition across all four sides.
-   **Seamless Requirements**: The generated pattern must tile indefinitely without any visible seams, breaks, or discontinuities in the overall flow or design.

### 6. Avoid (Patterns)

-   Overly complex or highly detailed motifs that lose clarity when repeated.
-   Photorealistic, illustrative, painterly, or sketch-like styles.
-   Distorted, pixelated, or rasterized appearances.
-   Gradients, drop shadows, bevels, or overly textural elements.
-   Cluttered, dense, or inconsistent spacing that leads to visual noise.
-   Abstract forms without clear geometric or organic logic that appears random.
-   Misaligned or non-repeating edges that create visible seams or breaks in the pattern.
-   Excessive color palettes (more than 3 distinct colors).
-   Patterns that are too busy or visually distracting, detracting from primary content.
