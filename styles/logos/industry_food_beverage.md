### For LOGOS:

#### Form Language
*   **Dominant Forms:** Prioritize **combination marks** (64%), blending a distinct wordmark element with a supportive, often abstract or semi-abstract, symbolic graphic. **Wordmarks** (27%) are secondary, with **symbols** (7%) and **lettermarks** (2%) tertiary.
*   **Geometry Principles:** Employ predominantly **rounded** (17%) and **organic** (10%) forms. Curves should be smooth, generous, and flowing, avoiding abrupt transitions or sharp angles. Geometric elements (10%) must be softened with rounded corners and integrated fluidly, rather than standing as rigid, isolated shapes. Reference the organic undulations of the Sprite background shape, the curvilinear letterforms of "nonè," or the soft edges of the "Polar Bear" symbol.
*   **Construction Principles:**
    *   **Overlap (33%):** Utilize intentional layering of elements where one graphic or text component optically rests upon, or integrates into, another. This creates depth and visual connection without relying on shadows or 3D effects. For example, text may be positioned over a background shape, or elements may interweave.
    *   **Asymmetry (33%):** Design for optical balance rather than strict mathematical symmetry. Elements can be positioned off-center or have uneven visual weight to create dynamic tension and a sense of movement. The overall composition must still feel visually stable and balanced.
    *   **Variable Line Weight (33%):** Employ distinct variations in stroke thickness within typography or illustrative elements. Transitions in line weight should be smooth and deliberate, adding character, emphasizing specific parts, and enhancing legibility. This is evident in the custom lettering of "Café Notman."
*   **Avoid:** Strictly angular, rectilinear, or purely pointed forms without any softening. Avoid overly complex or fragmented shapes that reduce immediate recognition. Eschew forms that are exclusively composed of thin outlines without solid fills.

#### Style Constraints
*   **Rendering Style:** **Flat** (8%) and **minimal** (10%). All elements must appear as solid, untextured shapes without gradients, shadows, bevels, inner shadows, or photographic details. The aesthetic should be clean, vector-based, and strictly two-dimensional.
*   **Fill vs. Outline:** Predominantly solid filled shapes and typography. Outlines are permissible for decorative accents or subtle internal details, but should not constitute the primary structure or silhouette of the logo. When outlines are used, they must have a distinct, generous weight or deliberately varied weight as part of the overall design.
*   **Complexity Level:** Minimal to moderate. Logos should be easily recognizable and comprehensible at a glance, featuring a limited number of distinct, impactful elements. Aim for simplicity that conveys a clear message and personality.
*   **Avoid:** Gradients, drop shadows, inner shadows, metallic effects, textures, photorealism, skeuomorphism, or 3D rendering. Avoid excessive detail that reduces clarity or legibility when scaled.

#### Technical Specs
*   **Stroke Weights:** Where lines are used (e.g., in illustrative elements, outlines, or variable typography), employ generous stroke weights that maintain visibility and integrity at small scales. When variable line weight is applied, ensure smooth transitions and maintain sufficient contrast between thick and thin areas. Minimum effective stroke weight should be equivalent to 1/20th of the overall logo's bounding box height for consistent legibility across applications.
*   **Proportions:** Establish clear visual hierarchy through intentional sizing relationships. While asymmetry (33%) is encouraged, maintain overall optical balance. For combination marks, text typically occupies 60-80% of the dominant visual space, with the symbol interacting harmoniously within the remaining area. Utilize principles like the golden ratio for underlying proportional harmony.
*   **Spacing (Kerning & Tracking):** Maintain generous and optically balanced spacing between individual letterforms (kerning) and overall word spacing (tracking) to prevent crowding and enhance readability. Internal spacing within graphic elements should also be open and airy. Ensure a consistent "breathing room" around all logo components.
*   **Scalability:** All design elements must be vector-based to ensure infinite scalability without any loss of quality or introduction of pixelation. All details, including fine strokes and intricate curves, must remain clear and distinct when scaled down to a minimum display size of 16x16 pixels and up to large format applications.
*   **Avoid:** Hairline strokes that disappear or become indistinct at small sizes. Avoid overly tight kerning or tracking that compromises legibility. Avoid arbitrary or disproportionate scaling of elements that distorts the logo's intended form.

#### Composition
*   **Centering:** Optically center the primary logo element within its given canvas or clear space. While overall compositions can be asymmetrical, the central focus should feel balanced. For combination marks, the wordmark often forms a horizontal anchor, with the symbol interacting dynamically around it.
*   **Padding (Clear Space):** Define a minimum clear space around the entire logo to ensure its prominence and prevent visual interference. This clear space should be consistently applied and should be at least 1/4th of the logo's overall height or width (whichever is smaller).
*   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** Maintain a strong, unambiguous figure-ground relationship. Logo elements should clearly stand out against their background, facilitated by **high-contrast** (33%) color usage (e.g., solid white on a vibrant background, as seen in the reference images).
*   **Avoid:** Placing the logo too close to other graphic elements, text, or page edges, violating clear space requirements. Avoid backgrounds with busy patterns or conflicting colors that interfere with logo legibility. Avoid compositions where key elements are cut off or bleed off the canvas without a deliberate design intention.

#### Avoid (Logos)
*   **Visual Anti-patterns:**
    *   Gradients, volumetric shadows, inner shadows, bevels, or any 3D rendering effects.
    *   Textures, patterns, or photographic elements embedded within the logo's core form.
    *   Hard, sharp edges, or strictly geometric forms that lack rounded softening or organic flow.
    *   Overly complex details or excessive ornamentation that hinder scalability or quick recognition.
    *   Skeuomorphism or photorealistic depictions.
    *   Low-contrast color combinations that make the logo difficult to discern from its background.
    *   Inconsistent stroke weights or arbitrary line variations without a clear design rationale.
    *   Crowded compositions with insufficient clear space around or within elements.
    *   Visually unbalanced or lopsided compositions without intentional asymmetrical design principles.
    *   Multiple, competing focal points that confuse the viewer.

### For PATTERNS:

#### Motif Rules
*   **Dominant Motif Types:** Employ abstract **organic shapes**, fluid curvilinear lines, **rounded geometric forms**, and highly simplified, iconic representations directly related to the beverage industry (e.g., stylized bubbles, water drops, fruit slices, gentle waves, or simplified vessel outlines). Motifs should intrinsically reflect the "organic" and "rounded" styles observed in the logo collection.
*   **Geometric Principles:** Motifs should primarily consist of soft curves, arcs, and generous rounded corners. While individual elements can exhibit subtle **asymmetry**, their internal structure must remain clean, clear, and simplified. Shapes should suggest fluidity, dynamism, and natural movement.

#### Emotional & Personality Impact
*   Patterns should powerfully evoke a sense of **playfulness (25%), dynamism (25%), friendliness (25%),** and **trustworthiness (25%)**. This translates to designs that feel approachable, energetic, engaging, and inviting, without being overly chaotic or childish. The overall vibe should convey a positive and lively brand energy appropriate for the beverage industry.

#### Grid System
*   **Tiling Method:** Implement a seamless, repeatable tiling system. Options include **brick repeats**, **half-drop repeats**, or organically distributed **scatter repeats** with intentional placement for visual balance. The chosen method must enhance the dynamic and playful mood rather than creating rigid regularity.
*   **Spacing:** Motifs should have generous and consistent spacing to allow for ample visual breathing room. Avoid both excessive clutter and feeling too sparse. The spacing should contribute to the overall rhythm and flow of the pattern.
*   **Density:** Aim for a medium density where the background color contributes significantly to the pattern's overall appearance, allowing individual motifs to stand out without overwhelming the viewer.

#### Style Constraints
*   **Rendering:** Strictly **flat**, two-dimensional rendering. No gradients, shadows, highlights, textures, or 3D effects. Motifs should be rendered as solid fills or clean, uniform outlines.
*   **Color Usage:** Adhere to a limited, concise color palette, predominantly **duo-tone** (33%) or tri-color. Utilize **vibrant** (33%) and **high-contrast** (33%) color combinations. All colors should be solid, flat, and untextured.
*   **Complexity:** Motifs must be simple, iconic, and easily identifiable. Avoid intricate details, fine lines, or photorealistic elements. The pattern's visual richness should arise from the arrangement and interaction of these simple shapes, not from the individual motifs' internal complexity.

#### Tiling Technical
*   **Edge Alignment:** All motifs and their components must align perfectly at the edges of the defined tile, ensuring a seamless and continuous flow when repeated horizontally and vertically. There should be no visible breaks, gaps, or abrupt cut-offs that disrupt the pattern's integrity.
*   **Seamless Requirements:** The pattern must repeat infinitely without any discernible seams, overlaps, or discrepancies at the tile boundaries. The transition from one tile to the next must be optically invisible, creating a continuous, unbroken surface.

#### Avoid (Patterns)
*   **Visual Anti-patterns:**
    *   Gradients, textures, photographic elements, or any form of realism within motifs.
    *   Hard-edged, sharp, or strictly geometric motifs that lack rounded softening or organic qualities.
    *   Overly complex or highly illustrative motifs that cannot be easily simplified into flat, iconic forms.
    *   Monotonous, predictable grid-based repetitions that lack dynamism or playful variation.
    *   Sparse patterns that feel empty and unengaging, or overly dense patterns that feel cluttered and overwhelming.
    *   Visible tiling seams, misaligned edges, or breaks in motif continuity.
    *   Low-contrast color schemes that cause motifs to blend into the background, reducing visibility.
    *   Muted, desaturated, or earthy color palettes.
    *   Patterns that include complex text or typographic elements, as this is reserved for logos.
    *   Randomly placed motifs without consideration for visual balance, rhythm, or overall compositional harmony.
