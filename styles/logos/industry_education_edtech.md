## For LOGOS:

### 1. Form Language

*   **Dominant Shapes:** Primarily geometric primitives including squares, rectangles, circles, triangles, and straight lines. Arcs and curves, when present, must be smooth, consistent, and derived from simple circular segments or geometric radii.
*   **Geometry Rules:** Logo construction is strictly grid-based and modular. Elements should align to an implied or explicit grid system. Forms are often blocky, solid, and structurally robust. Intersections and overlaps between shapes should be precise and intentional.
*   **Construction Principles:** Focus on reductive design, distilling concepts into their simplest geometric forms. Emphasize clarity and directness. Implicit three-dimensional forms are acceptable if rendered using flat, geometric planes and clear perspective rather than complex shading.

### 2. Style Constraints

*   **Rendering Style:** Flat 2D vector graphic representation. All elements should appear as if cut from paper or digitally constructed.
*   **Fill vs Outline:** Predominantly uses solid fills for all graphic elements. Outlines are permissible only for specific graphic effects, such as defining negative space boundaries or creating implied depth for structural elements (e.g., Ref #3), and must maintain a consistent stroke weight within a given mark.
*   **Complexity Level:** Minimalist. Logos should be highly reductive, focusing on essential shapes and concepts. Avoid unnecessary ornamentation or superfluous detail.

### 3. Technical Specs

*   **Stroke Weights:** If outlines are utilized, stroke weights must be uniform across all outlining elements within the logo and optically balanced relative to the overall size of the mark. A typical range for stroke weight is 2-4% of the logo's bounding box height for optical clarity at various sizes.
*   **Proportions:** All elements should adhere to discernible geometric ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, or simple modular units like a consistent `x` unit). Maintain visual harmony through proportional relationships between components.
*   **Spacing:** Internal spacing between elements (e.g., components of a symbol, character spacing in wordmarks, or negative space) must be consistent and derived from a base modular unit. This ensures optical balance and clarity.
*   **Scalability:** Logos must be optimized for infinite scalability, retaining crispness and legibility at all sizes, from favicons to large-format signage.

### 4. Composition

*   **Centering:** Logos (or the primary graphical element in a combination mark) should be optically centered within their defined clear space.
*   **Padding:** A minimum clear space around the logo must be maintained, typically no less than 20% of the logo's bounding box height on all sides, or equivalent to the `x`-height of the primary wordmark text.
*   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** Must exhibit a strong and unambiguous figure-ground relationship. Negative space is a critical design element, often used to define forms, create implied imagery, or enhance visual interest (e.g., Ref #1, #4, #5).
*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Negative Space:** Actively utilize negative space to define secondary forms or convey additional meaning.
    *   **Asymmetry:** Employ asymmetric balance to create dynamic and innovative compositions while maintaining overall stability.
    *   **Overlap:** Use overlapping shapes to create new forms, imply depth, or suggest interaction between elements.

### 5. Avoid (Logos)

*   Gradients, complex textures, or photographic elements.
*   Drop shadows, bevels, embossing, or realistic 3D renderings (unless simplified, flat-shaded geometric forms).
*   Hand-drawn, organic, fluid, or highly irregular shapes.
*   Scribbles, brush strokes, watercolor effects, or highly artistic/illustrative styles.
*   Excessive detail, intricate ornamentation, or busy compositions.
*   Multiple clashing colors or complex color palettes (stick to monochrome or high-contrast dual-color schemes).
*   Thin, delicate lines that diminish legibility at small sizes or lose impact.
*   Complex pictograms or detailed illustrations as primary logo forms.

## For PATTERNS:

### 1. Motif Rules

*   **Dominant Motif Types:** Motifs should be derived from simplified, geometric elements found in the primary logo, or be abstract geometric shapes (squares, circles, triangles, lines, L-shapes). They should be highly reductive and iconic.
*   **Geometric Principles:** Motifs must adhere to strict geometric construction, utilizing clean lines, precise angles, and consistent curves. Repetition of these simple geometric forms is fundamental.

### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact

*   **Emotional & Personality Impact:** The pattern should convey a sense of modern confidence, innovative precision, and structured playfulness. It should feel intelligent and contemporary, creating a dynamic yet composed brand energy.

### 3. Grid System

*   **Tiling Method:** Patterns must be constructed on a seamless, repeatable grid system, typically orthogonal (square or rectangular) or isometric. Tiling should be clean, precise, and visually continuous.
*   **Spacing:** Consistent, clear spacing between individual motifs and repeating units is crucial. This spacing should be derived from a defined modular unit, preventing clutter.
*   **Density:** Aim for a medium density. Motifs should be discernible and have enough negative space around them to breathe, avoiding an overly busy or sparse appearance.

### 4. Style Constraints

*   **Rendering:** Flat 2D vector rendering. Motifs should have solid fills.
*   **Color Usage:** Restricted to monochrome (a single color for motifs on a contrasting background) or a high-contrast dual-color scheme. Colors should be either desaturated, muted, or a single vibrant hue against a neutral background.
*   **Complexity:** Minimalist motifs and simple, repetitive arrangements. The overall pattern should be clean and uncluttered.

### 5. Tiling Technical

*   **Edge Alignment:** Motifs must align perfectly at the edges of the pattern tile, ensuring seamless repetition across horizontal and vertical axes.
*   **Seamless Requirements:** The pattern must tile infinitely without any visible seams, breaks, or discontinuities in the flow or arrangement of motifs. All elements should terminate cleanly at tile boundaries.

### 6. Avoid (Patterns)

*   Photographic elements, realistic renderings, or skeuomorphic textures.
*   Organic, free-form, hand-drawn, or highly detailed motifs.
*   Random, non-repeating, or chaotic arrangements.
*   Complex color palettes, gradients within motifs, or subtle tonal variations that break the flat aesthetic.
*   Patterns that appear busy, overly dense, or visually overwhelming.
*   Irregular motif edges or inconsistent spacing that disrupts the grid.
*   Patterns with visible seams, breaks, or misalignments when tiled.
