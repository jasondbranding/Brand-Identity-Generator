### For LOGOS:

#### 1. Form Language
*   **Dominant Shapes**: Prioritize geometric primitives such as squares, circles, triangles, rectangles, and their derivative polygons. Forms are often constructed from precise angles (e.g., 45, 90 degrees) and straight lines. Subtle, mathematically defined curves are permissible but must maintain overall geometric integrity.
*   **Geometry Rules**: Emphasize rigid geometric construction. Forms should appear engineered or algorithmically generated. Utilize rotational symmetry, reflectional symmetry, or well-balanced asymmetry. Components should align perfectly to a foundational grid.
*   **Construction Principles**: Logos are primarily constructed using modular elements. Repeatable units are combined or subtracted to create a unified, abstract symbol. Negative space is a fundamental design tool, actively shaping and defining internal or external forms (e.g., creating implied shapes or internal divisions). Overlapping or interlocking geometric planes are common.

#### 2. Style Constraints
*   **Rendering Style**: Strictly flat, two-dimensional graphic presentation. Solid color fills are paramount. Gradients, if used, should be simple, smooth, and directional, typically from one primary color to a secondary or tertiary shade of the same hue, or a complementary cool tone, applied within a single enclosed shape.
*   **Fill vs. Outline**: Predominantly filled shapes. If an outline is used, it should be derived from the negative space of a filled form, or be a solid, consistent stroke defining the overall silhouette. Purely outlined logos are less common; the style leans towards solid presence.
*   **Complexity Level**: Minimalist and highly abstracted. Logos should be reductive, conveying complex ideas through simplified, symbolic forms. Avoid unnecessary ornamentation, intricate details, or decorative flourishes. The visual language is concise and essential.

#### 3. Technical Specs
*   **Stroke Weights**: For any linear elements or implied strokes formed by negative space, maintain uniform and consistent weight throughout the symbol. No variable width strokes. Aim for a stroke-to-negative-space ratio that ensures clarity and legibility at small sizes.
*   **Proportions**: All elements within the logo system (symbol, wordmark, spacing) should adhere to a strict proportional system, ideally based on simple integer ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 2:3) or geometric progressions. Symbols should often fit within a perfect square or circular bounding box.
*   **Spacing**: Consistent clear space (padding) between internal elements of the symbol and between the symbol and any accompanying wordmark. Spacing should be derived from a base unit, often an 'X' height or cap height of the associated wordmark, ensuring legibility and optical balance.
*   **Scalability**: Design must be natively vector-based to guarantee infinite scalability without loss of fidelity. Simplify details to maintain impact and recognition across all scales, from favicon to large format signage.

#### 4. Composition
*   **Centering**: The symbol component should be optically centered within its designated clear space. For combination marks, the symbol and wordmark should achieve horizontal and vertical optical balance, often with the symbol aligned to the left of the wordmark, and their baselines or horizontal centers aligned.
*   **Padding**: A minimum clear space around the entire logo unit equal to or greater than the height of the smallest significant element (e.g., the 'x-height' of the wordmark) should be maintained to ensure visual isolation.
*   **Figure-Ground Ratio**: Emphasize a strong, clear distinction between the logo and its background. High-contrast color pairings are critical to ensure the logo is immediately discernible. Negative space within the logo should be intentionally designed to contribute to the form and legibility, not appear as accidental voids.

#### 5. Avoid (Logos)
*   Organic, fluid, hand-drawn, or illustrative forms lacking geometric precision.
*   Skeuomorphic elements, complex textures, drop shadows, inner shadows, bevels, embossing, or 3D extrusions.
*   Gradients that are complex, multi-directional, or utilize an excessive number of colors (limit to two-tone, subtle transitions).
*   Inconsistent stroke weights, decorative serifs, or overly stylized script fonts for wordmarks.
*   Logos that appear busy, cluttered, or contain excessive fine detail that compromises scalability.
*   Low contrast color combinations that make the logo difficult to distinguish from its background.
*   Cartoonish, whimsical, or childish aesthetics.
*   Generic stock imagery or clip art visual language.

### For PATTERNS:

#### 1. Motif Rules
*   **Dominant Motif Types**: Motifs should be abstract, geometric shapes, directly derived or simplified from the core geometry and principles of the primary logo mark. These could be repeating elements, angular forms, or abstracted fragments. Common types include repeating lines, polygons, tessellating arrows, or interconnected nodes.
*   **Geometric Principles**: All motifs must adhere to strict geometric construction, using straight lines, precise angles, and mathematically defined curves. Modularity is key; patterns should appear to be built from repeating, identical, or rotationally/reflectionally symmetrical base units.
*   Patterns must function as an extension of the brand's core identity, reinforcing the logo's visual language rather than introducing new, disconnected elements.

#### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact
*   **Vibe**: The patterns should evoke feelings of confidence, trustworthiness, innovation, stability, and modern sophistication. They should feel purposeful, precise, and forward-thinking.
*   **Psychological Brand Energy**: Structured, analytical, dynamic, efficient, secure, and technologically advanced. The patterns should convey order, interconnectedness, and a controlled sense of movement or energy, aligning with a professional, cutting-edge technology identity.

#### 3. Grid System
*   **Tiling Method**: Patterns should be built upon robust, visible or implied grid systems. Common tiling methods include square, rectangular, diamond, or isometric grid arrangements. Tessellating patterns where motifs interlock seamlessly are highly preferred. Offset or staggered grids can be used to introduce dynamism while maintaining order.
*   **Spacing**: Consistent, calculated spacing between motifs. This spacing should be derived from a base unit, ensuring visual harmony and preventing overcrowding or sparseness. Grid lines should inform motif placement and separation.
*   **Density**: Patterns can range from low-density (sparse, minimalist, sophisticated, providing breathing room) to medium-density (energetic, dynamic, but still maintaining clarity). Avoid overly dense or chaotic arrangements that obscure individual motifs.

#### 4. Style Constraints (Patterns)
*   **Rendering**: Flat, two-dimensional graphic rendering. Motifs are typically solid-filled shapes or defined by consistent-weight outlines.
*   **Color Usage**: Patterns should predominantly use a restricted color palette, most commonly duo-tone. This involves one primary color for the motif and a contrasting background, or subtle tonal variations of a single hue. High contrast is preferred. Cool and dark color foundations are characteristic, with occasional vibrant accents.
*   **Complexity**: Minimalist in motif detail. Complexity should arise from the ingenious arrangement and repetition of simple geometric forms, rather than intricate individual motif designs. No textures, photographic elements, or gradients within individual small repeating motifs, though a subtle background gradient is acceptable.

#### 5. Tiling Technical
*   **Edge Alignment**: Motifs must align perfectly at the tile boundaries to ensure a continuous, unbroken visual flow across the entire pattern. Elements should appear to continue from one tile into the next without interruption.
*   **Seamless Requirements**: Patterns must be perfectly tileable horizontally and vertically, creating an infinite, seamless repeat. There should be no discernible seams, breaks, or abrupt changes in the pattern's flow when tiled. The repeat unit itself must be expertly crafted to blend imperceptibly.

#### 6. Avoid (Patterns)
*   Organic, fluid, abstract expressionistic, or whimsical motifs that lack geometric rigor.
*   Random, unstructured, or free-form arrangements; patterns must clearly demonstrate a foundational grid or systematic repetition.
*   High-detail textures, photographic elements, or realistic rendering within motifs.
*   Overly complex or clashing multi-color palettes; adhere strictly to duo-tone or very limited analogous palettes.
*   Patterns that appear busy, chaotic, or lack clear motif definition and spacing.
*   Visible tiling seams, broken alignments, or non-repeating elements that disrupt continuity.
*   Patterns conveying a childish, retro, overly decorative, or traditional aesthetic.
*   Gradient meshes or complex lighting effects within individual pattern motifs.
