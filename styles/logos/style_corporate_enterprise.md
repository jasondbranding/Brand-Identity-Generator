### For LOGOS:

1.  **Form Language**
    *   **Dominant Shapes:** Primarily constructed from fundamental geometric primitives: perfect circles, arcs, precise squares, rectangles, triangles, and straight lines. Curved elements are derived from consistent radii. Implied or explicit grids dictate structure.
    *   **Geometry Rules:** All forms adhere to strict geometric principles. Curves are smooth Bézier curves with minimal anchor points, reflecting ideal mathematical arcs. Angles are typically 45 or 90 degrees unless intentionally designed for dynamic asymmetry within a geometric framework. Shapes are often modular, built from interlocking or intersecting units.
    *   **Construction Principles:** Logos exhibit a strong sense of underlying grid construction. Elements frequently employ positive and negative space in a balanced interplay, where negative space is an active design component. Symmetry (bilateral, radial, or translational) is a common organizational principle. Form relationships are based on established design ratios, such as the Golden Ratio or simple integer proportions (e.g., 1:1, 1:2).

2.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering Style:** Flat, two-dimensional vector graphics with solid, uniform color fills. Edges are crisp, sharp, and clean, free of anti-aliasing artifacts when rendered.
    *   **Fill vs Outline:** Predominantly solid filled shapes. If outlines are used, they must be of substantial, uniform weight, effectively defining a solid shape with an internal negative space, rather than a thin stroke. No decorative or subtle outlines.
    *   **Complexity Level:** Extremely minimal and abstract. Logos consist of a limited number of distinct visual elements (typically 1-3 primary forms). They are highly distilled representations, focusing on essential form and concept rather than detail or embellishment.

3.  **Technical Specs**
    *   **Stroke Weights:** All lines and curves within a logo's symbolic or letterform elements must maintain uniform, consistent stroke weights. Weights should be robust (e.g., visually equivalent to a medium-bold to bold typeface stroke) to ensure clarity and impact at scale.
    *   **Proportions:** Elements are proportioned based on harmonious mathematical ratios. Visual weight distribution is balanced, preventing any single component from appearing disproportionately heavy or light. The overall form maintains an optical balance, often centered within a square or circular bounding box.
    *   **Spacing:** Generous and consistent negative space (whitespace) is fundamental. Internal counters, spacing between elements, and kerning in wordmarks are optically balanced and ample, ensuring clear separation and readability. A clear space margin of at least 1x the smallest dimension of the logo's bounding box should be maintained around the logo.
    *   **Scalability:** Designs must be inherently scalable from very small (e.g., app icon) to very large (e.g., billboard) without loss of legibility, detail, or impact. Intricate details that pixelate or disappear at small sizes are strictly prohibited.

4.  **Composition**
    *   **Centering:** The primary logo element (symbol or wordmark) should be optically centered, both horizontally and vertically, within its defined clear space. For combination marks, the relationship between symbol and wordmark is precisely aligned on a common baseline or central axis.
    *   **Padding:** A minimum clear space equivalent to 100% of the smallest dimension of the logo's bounding box must be maintained on all sides. This ensures the logo stands alone without visual interference.
    *   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** A balanced interplay between positive (figure) and negative (ground) space. Neither the figure nor the ground should visually dominate to the point of obscuring the other. Negative space is often used constructively to form secondary shapes or enhance the primary form.

5.  **Avoid**
    *   **Visual Anti-Patterns:**
        *   Gradients, textures, patterns, drop shadows, bevels, embossing, inner glows, reflections, or 3D effects within the logo elements.
        *   Ornate serifs, script fonts, handwritten typography, decorative fonts, or grunge styles.
        *   Complex illustrations, detailed imagery, caricatures, mascots, or any form of photorealistic elements.
        *   Thin, hairline strokes, inconsistent stroke weights, or delicate forms that lack visual robustness.
        *   Unbalanced, asymmetrical compositions lacking clear underlying geometric or rational structure.
        *   Overlapping elements without a deliberate geometric or negative space purpose.
        *   More than three distinct colors within the logo itself.
        *   Distressed effects, rough edges, or organic, free-form shapes.

### For PATTERNS:

1.  **Motif Rules**
    *   **Dominant Motif Types:** Abstract geometric shapes, repeating linear elements (e.g., waves, stripes), tessellations of basic forms (squares, triangles, hexagons, circles, arcs). Motifs are structured, ordered, and often evoke technological or architectural forms.
    *   **Geometric Principles:** All motifs are constructed from strict geometric primitives and adhere to a clear, underlying grid. Curves are smooth and derived from consistent radii; lines are straight and angles precise. Motifs are typically regular and uniform in their design.
    *   **Not Organic, Freeform:** Avoid any motifs that appear hand-drawn, organic, irregular, or naturalistic (e.g., leaves, flowers, splatters).

2.  **Emotional & Personality Impact**
    *   **How the Pattern Feels:** Professional, sophisticated, modern, organized, stable, precise, technical, structured, calm, subtle.
    *   **Psychological Brand Energy:** Reliable, forward-thinking, trustworthy, efficient, innovative, controlled, and understated.
    *   **Vibe it Creates:** A backdrop of quiet confidence and structured elegance. Supports brand authority without being ostentatious or distracting.

3.  **Grid System**
    *   **Tiling Method:** Patterns are seamlessly tiled, employing orthogonal, diagonal, or curvilinear repetition based on an explicit geometric axis or grid. Common methods include brick, offset, mirror, or regular tessellations.
    *   **Spacing:** Consistent, generous, and optically balanced spacing between repeating motifs. Negative space is integral to the pattern's structure and rhythm. Motifs should not appear crowded or dense.
    *   **Density:** Medium to low density. Patterns are intended to be subtle background elements, not visually overpowering. The overall visual weight is light to moderate, allowing primary content to stand out.

4.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering:** Flat, two-dimensional vector graphics. Motifs use solid color fills or very subtle, smooth linear gradients (as seen in Ref 1's background pattern) that enhance form and depth without being distracting. No complex textures or photographic elements.
    *   **Color Usage:** Restricted palettes, typically monochromatic, duotone, or closely analogous color schemes. Colors are often muted, desaturated, or tonal variations of a single hue. High contrast is avoided, aiming for a harmonious, subtle integration with the overall visual identity.
    *   **Complexity:** Low to medium complexity. Patterns consist of simple, easily discernible repeating units. Avoid high-frequency details, intricate ornamentation, or busy visual noise.

5.  **Tiling Technical**
    *   **Edge Alignment:** Pattern motifs must align perfectly at all four edges of the tile, ensuring absolute continuity when repeated. No visible breaks, shifts, or misalignments.
    *   **Seamless Requirements:** The pattern must be infinitely repeatable in all directions without any discernible seams or interruptions in the visual flow. This necessitates careful planning of motif halves or continuations at the tile boundaries.

6.  **Avoid**
    *   **Visual Anti-Patterns:**
        *   Organic, hand-drawn, distressed, grunge, or otherwise imperfect textures or motifs.
        *   Figurative, illustrative, or photorealistic elements.
        *   High-contrast, jarring, or overly vibrant color combinations.
        *   Random, chaotic, or unstructured arrangements that lack a clear underlying grid logic.
        *   Overly dense or visually chaotic patterns that compete with main content.
        *   Patterns with intricate details that degrade or lose integrity upon repetition or scaling.
        *   Patterns that include drop shadows, bevels, or complex lighting effects within the motifs themselves.
        *   Designs that produce Moiré patterns or visual interference at different scales.
