### For LOGOS:

#### 1. Form Language
-   **Dominant Shapes:** Primarily rectilinear forms (squares, rectangles, straight lines), curvilinear forms (arcs, circles, ellipses, smoothly rounded corners), and geometric polygons. These are often combined or interact to create more complex but still geometrically defined structures.
-   **Geometry Rules:** Construction is based on strict geometric primitives and principles. Forms are derived using foundational grids, construction lines, and mathematical ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:1.618 - Golden Ratio, 1:2). Angles are precise, typically multiples of 45 or 90 degrees, with occasional controlled acute or obtuse angles for dynamicism.
-   **Construction Principles:** Emphasis on modularity, where elements interlock, repeat, or are assembled from consistent components. Continuity, where a single path or ribbon-like element forms the logo, is common. Extensive use of negative space as an integral design element, defining shapes or creating secondary meanings. Forms often imply three-dimensionality through isometric projection, angled planes, or layering, without resorting to photorealistic rendering. Rounded corners are prevalent, applied with consistent radii across relevant elements.

#### 2. Style Constraints
-   **Rendering Style:** Predominantly vector-based, characterized by clean, sharp edges and crisp lines. Anti-aliasing should be smooth and subtle, ensuring clarity at all scales.
-   **Fill vs Outline:** Primarily solid filled forms. Outlines are rarely used as a primary stylistic element; when present, they are significant in weight and often define negative space or create ribbon-like effects, rather than merely outlining a filled shape.
-   **Complexity Level:** Minimalist and reductive. Designs are stripped down to their most essential elements to convey a single, clear idea. Avoid extraneous detail, complex textures, or busy compositions.
-   **Color Usage:** Typically monochromatic or duotone. Logo elements feature flat, uniform colors or subtle linear gradients within a single plane to suggest depth without excessive complexity. Colors should be distinct, clear, and impactful (e.g., vibrant, muted, stark).

#### 3. Technical Specs
-   **Stroke Weights:** Not applicable for primarily filled logos. For elements functioning as strokes or defining negative space (e.g., gaps, cutouts), maintain a uniform, medium-to-thick weight. If outlining is specifically employed, the stroke weight should be substantial, typically 1/8 to 1/10 of the smallest dimension of the logo's bounding box, to ensure visibility and impact at varying sizes.
-   **Proportions:** Built upon consistent geometric ratios, commonly square (1:1), or based on ratios such as 1:1.618, 1:2, 4:5, 5:4. Overall logo aspect ratios are usually balanced to fit comfortably within a square or near-square visual field.
-   **Spacing:** All internal spacing between elements is meticulously controlled and consistent, often derived from multiples of a foundational modular unit or a consistent stroke weight. Negative space is deliberately designed and proportional to positive space.
-   **Scalability:** Designed for absolute scalability, maintaining clarity and integrity from micro sizes (e.g., 16x16 pixels) to large-format applications. Simplicity and vector construction are paramount for this attribute.

#### 4. Composition
-   **Centering:** Logos are almost always precisely center-aligned within their defined canvas or bounding box, both horizontally and vertically, promoting a sense of stability, balance, and formal correctness.
-   **Padding:** A minimum clear space (padding) must be maintained around the logo. This clear space should be no less than 1/4 of the logo's overall height or width, or equivalent to the height of a key internal element (e.g., stroke width, internal gap).
-   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** A balanced and intentional relationship between positive (figure) and negative (ground) space. The dominant logo element (figure) should typically occupy 60-80% of the overall visual area, with negative space forming the remaining 20-40%, often acting as an active design component.

#### 5. Avoid
-   Excessive ornamentation, gratuitous detail, skeuomorphism, or photographic elements.
-   Complex multi-color gradients, reflections, lens flares, drop shadows, inner shadows, bevels, or glows that create photorealistic effects.
-   Thin, hairline strokes or intricate details that compromise legibility and impact at small scales.
-   Visually unbalanced or highly asymmetrical compositions that lack an underlying geometric rationale or harmonic structure.
-   Raster-based textures, pixelated effects, or blurred edges.
-   Cluttered designs with too many disparate elements or competing visual ideas.
-   Irregular, freehand, or highly organic shapes that deviate from strict geometric principles, unless geometrically stylized with consistent curves.

### For PATTERNS:

#### 1. Motif Rules
-   **Dominant Motif Types:** Motifs are derived from fundamental geometric shapes (squares, circles, triangles, lines, arcs) or highly simplified, abstract symbols. They often feature the same rounded corners or precise angles found in the logo style.
-   **Geometric Principles:** Motif construction adheres to strong geometric principles, utilizing grids, symmetry (axial, rotational, reflective), and consistent proportional relationships. Motifs are designed for precise tessellation or structured arrangement.

#### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact
-   **Impact:** Patterns should evoke feelings of order, precision, sophistication, and modernity.
-   **Psychological Brand Energy:** Conveys attributes such as intelligence, efficiency, stability, trust, and a forward-thinking perspective.
-   **Vibe:** Creates a calm, systematic, structured, and understated atmosphere. The aesthetic is clean and controlled, avoiding chaotic, overtly playful, or aggressive connotations.

#### 3. Grid System
-   **Tiling Method:** Utilizes seamless, repeating grids, predominantly square or rectangular. Hexagonal or triangular grids are permissible if geometric consistency is maintained.
-   **Spacing:** Consistent, uniform spacing between individual motifs, directly derived from a modular grid unit. Spacing should be generous enough to allow motifs to be distinct but close enough to create a cohesive repetitive structure.
-   **Density:** Medium to low density is preferred to uphold minimalist principles. Motif coverage typically ranges from 30-50% of the overall pattern area, emphasizing the role of negative space.

#### 4. Style Constraints
-   **Rendering:** Flat, two-dimensional, vector-based rendering with clean, sharp edges.
-   **Color Usage:** Monochromatic, duotone, or tritone palettes. Colors are typically flat and uniform, often employing subtle variations of a single hue, or contrasting light and dark values. Avoid complex gradients or textural fills.
-   **Complexity:** Minimalist. Patterns are composed of simple, easily identifiable motifs without intricate internal details. Complexity emerges from the structured repetition and interaction of these simple forms.

#### 5. Tiling Technical
-   **Edge Alignment:** Requires perfect seamlessness at all tile boundaries. Any motif elements crossing an edge must align precisely with the corresponding element on the adjacent tile to create an uninterrupted flow.
-   **Seamless Requirements:** The pattern unit must be meticulously designed to interlock flawlessly when repeated. There should be no visible seams, abrupt cuts, or misalignments when the pattern is tiled infinitely.

#### 6. Avoid
-   Overly intricate, busy, or visually noisy patterns.
-   Organic, freehand, or highly irregular motifs lacking geometric grounding.
-   Photographic, raster-based, or low-resolution elements within the pattern.
-   Strong gradients, drop shadows, or heavily textured fills that detract from the flat, minimalist aesthetic.
-   Patterns that exhibit visible breaks, discontinuities, or a non-repeating appearance when tiled.
-   Random, arbitrary placement or uneven spacing of motifs.
-   Motifs that create unintentional optical illusions, visual discomfort, or conflicting design languages.
