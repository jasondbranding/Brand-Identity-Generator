# Style Guide: Brutalist Geometric Bold

This style guide captures the dominant visual language of the reference collection, emphasizing a robust, geometric, and high-contrast aesthetic suitable for AI image generation.

## For LOGOS:

### 1. Form Language

*   **Dominant Shapes:** Logos are constructed primarily from geometric primitives: robust squares, rectangles, circles, triangles, and octagonal forms. These shapes are often deconstructed, intersected, or combined.
*   **Geometry Rules:** Strict adherence to orthogonal and diagonal lines. Forms display precise angular cuts (typically 45 or 90 degrees) or deliberately controlled radii for softened corners on otherwise rigid structures. Elements are often modular, built from a foundational grid system.
*   **Construction Principles:** Strong emphasis on interlocking and overlapping components, creating a sense of depth and complexity through simple means. Negative space is intentionally integrated to define internal forms or optical illusions. Forms convey solidity, weight, and architectural stability.

### 2. Style Constraints

*   **Rendering Style:** Vector graphic aesthetic. Output must feature crisp, clean edges with absolute precision. All elements are flat, two-dimensional, and devoid of three-dimensional rendering effects. The overall impression is bold, unyielding, and graphically potent, aligning with brutalist design principles.
*   **Fill vs Outline:** Predominantly solid, uniform fills (100% opacity) or thick, consistent outlines. Combination marks may use outlines to define internal structures or create distinction between overlapping elements. Shadows are implied by overlap, not rendered.
*   **Complexity Level:** Moderate to high complexity, achieved through intricate arrangement, interweaving, and negative space utilization, rather than fine detail. Shapes are simplified to their geometric essence, but their interplay creates depth.

### 3. Technical Specs

*   **Stroke Weights:** For outlined forms, stroke weights are substantial, typically ranging from 10% to 20% of the overall character height or motif width. All strokes within a single defined element maintain uniform weight. When elements overlap, their intersecting strokes can create perceived variations in weight, but the underlying stroke remains consistent.
*   **Proportions:** Letterforms and symbols often adopt condensed, heavy-set, or expanded proportions to maximize visual impact. Aspect ratios for wordmarks tend towards broad or square compositions. Optical balancing of elements is critical.
*   **Spacing:** Tight kerning for wordmarks, maintaining minimal visual gaps between letters to form a cohesive block. For combination marks, a clear space equivalent to 1x the symbol's smallest dimension should separate the symbol from the wordmark. Internal negative space within forms is meticulously calculated and integral to the design.

### 4. Composition

*   **Centering:** Logos are typically centrally aligned within their bounding box, providing a strong, undeniable focal point. Wordmarks maintain a rigid baseline alignment.
*   **Padding:** A minimum clear space around the logo equivalent to the height of the smallest capital letter in a wordmark, or 20% of the logo's total bounding box dimension, must be maintained. This ensures visual prominence and isolation.
*   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** Extreme high-contrast figure-ground relationship. The logo should always be rendered in a color that creates maximum contrast with its background (e.g., pure black on white, pure white on black, or a single bold color on a neutral background). Negative space is active, often forming secondary shapes or contributing to the perception of overlap.

### 5. Avoid

*   Gradients, soft shadows, inner glows, bevels, or any complex textural overlays.
*   Thin, delicate, or excessively intricate line work that compromises legibility or impact.
*   Soft, curvilinear, organic, or fluid shapes as primary structural elements (unless contrasted sharply with dominant geometric forms).
*   Low-contrast color palettes, subtle tonal variations, or muted, pastel colors.
*   Overly decorative ornamentation, serifs, or flourishes unrelated to core geometric construction.
*   Photographic elements, pixelated effects, or raster-based rendering.
*   Hand-drawn, illustrative, or painterly styles.

## For PATTERNS:

### 1. Motif Rules

*   **Dominant Motif Types:** Abstract geometric forms directly derived from the core logo principles. Motifs include repetitive use of sharp angles, overlapping block elements, and thick lines. Deconstructed letterforms, segments of the logo's geometry, or simplified polygonal shapes are ideal.
*   **Geometric Principles:** Motifs are constructed from strict geometric primitives with precise angles and defined relationships. Transformation methods like rotation (90, 180, 270 degrees), mirroring, and direct repetition are fundamental. Elements frequently interlock or create optical illusions through their placement and implied overlap.

### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact

*   **How the Pattern Feels:** Robust, structured, energetic, and assertive. It communicates precision, modernity, and industrial strength.
*   **Psychological Brand Energy:** Confident, unyielding, cutting-edge, and dynamically powerful. It establishes a strong, memorable, and slightly mysterious brand presence.
*   **Vibe It Creates:** Architectural, sophisticatedly brutalist, contemporary urban, and controlled yet vibrant.

### 3. Grid System

*   **Tiling Method:** Patterns must be perfectly seamless, employing orthogonal tiling methods (e.g., brick, stack, mirrored repetition) or rotational symmetry within each tile module. Modules should interlock cleanly without breaks.
*   **Spacing:** Consistent and precise spacing between repeated motifs is crucial for clarity and visual rhythm. Spacing should allow motifs to be distinct while contributing to the overall pattern density, whether tight or more open.
*   **Density:** Moderate to high density patterns are preferred, creating a strong visual texture that feels substantial and well-defined without being chaotic.

### 4. Style Constraints

*   **Rendering:** Flat, vector-based graphics with razor-sharp edges. No gradients, textures, photographic elements, or volumetric effects are permitted.
*   **Color Usage:** Exclusively monochrome (black on white, white on black) or high-contrast pairings (e.g., a single bold, saturated color against a neutral or contrasting background). The palette is extremely limited, typically 1-2 dominant colors plus background.
*   **Complexity:** Patterns achieve complexity through the intricate arrangement and interaction of simple, geometric motifs. Individual motifs remain clear and identifiable.

### 5. Tiling Technical

*   **Edge Alignment:** Perfect edge-to-edge alignment is mandatory for seamless repetition across all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
*   **Seamless Requirements:** Patterns must be perfectly repeatable without any visible seams, breaks, or discontinuities in the motif flow when tiled. The edges of the pattern tile must align flawlessly with adjacent instances.

### 6. Avoid

*   Organic, flowing, naturalistic, or illustrative patterns.
*   Hand-drawn or imprecise line work, or patterns that appear "sketched."
*   Low-contrast, desaturated, or pastel color palettes.
*   Random, haphazard, or asymmetrical arrangements of motifs that lack a clear underlying grid structure.
*   Photographic or highly detailed pictorial motifs.
*   Gradients, soft shadows, or complex lighting effects within individual motifs or the overall pattern.
*   Patterns that appear busy, cluttered, or chaotic due to lack of defined structure or excessive detail.
