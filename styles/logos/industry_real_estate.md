# Style Guide

## For LOGOS:

### 1. Form Language
-   **Dominant Shapes:** Logos are constructed primarily from fundamental geometric primitives: squares, rectangles, triangles, and straight lines. Precise angles are paramount, typically orthogonal (90-degree) or 45-degree, with occasional use of 30 or 60-degree angles. Curves, if present, are arcs of perfect circles or elliptical segments, integrated with a strong geometric rationale. Polygons are favored over organic or freeform shapes.
-   **Geometry Rules:** Shapes strictly adhere to an underlying geometric grid system. Elements are often aligned to a baseline, cap height, or other proportional measurements derived from the grid. Forms are frequently derived through Boolean operations (union, subtraction, intersection) of simpler shapes, creating complex yet harmonious figures. Implied symmetry or balanced asymmetry is common.
-   **Construction Principles:** Marks often employ modular construction, where a basic unit is repeated, rotated, or mirrored. Negative space is actively utilized as a form-defining element, creating implicit shapes or reinforcing the primary motif (e.g., a house shape defined by an empty cutout). Abstract representation is preferred, distilling complex concepts (like buildings or initials) into minimalist geometric forms.

### 2. Style Constraints
-   **Rendering Style:** Flat, two-dimensional, vector-graphic appearance. Elements possess sharp, crisp edges and defined boundaries, devoid of rasterization artifacts or pixelation. A clean, precise aesthetic is paramount.
-   **Fill vs Outline:** Predominantly solid fills in a single, consistent color. When outlines are used (monoline style), they are uniform in weight and often complement or enclose a solid form. Internal details or variations are achieved through shape subtraction or precise line work rather than gradients or textures.
-   **Complexity Level:** Low to moderate. Logos are simplified to their essential geometric components, removing superfluous details. The visual message is conveyed with maximum clarity and minimal visual noise.
-   **Texture/Gradient:** Flat colors are the standard. Gradients are generally avoided. If a subtle gradient is absolutely necessary, it must be linear, monochromatic, and extremely subtle (e.g., 5-10% variation), used strictly for visual depth without compromising the flat aesthetic. No complex textures, photographic overlays, or material simulations.

### 3. Technical Specs
-   **Stroke Weights:** For monoline or outline-based logos, stroke weights are uniform across all lines and robust enough to maintain visibility at small scales. A common ratio is a stroke weight equal to 1/12th to 1/8th of the height of the symbol's bounding box. For combination marks, the stroke weight of the symbol should be visually harmonious with the letterforms' stem width.
-   **Proportions:** Logos exhibit inherent proportionality, often derived from classic ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:1.618 Golden Ratio, or 1:√2). Elements within the logo are scaled relative to each other using consistent geometric relationships, such as a base unit 'x' where elements are x, 2x, 3x, etc.
-   **Spacing:** Internal spacing (e.g., between elements in a symbol, or letters in a wordmark) is optically balanced and consistently applied. Clear space around the logo elements and between symbol and wordmark in a combination mark is crucial, often based on a proportional unit derived from the logo's geometry.
-   **Scalability:** Logos are designed for extreme scalability, functioning impeccably from small favicon sizes to large billboard applications. All elements must remain distinct and legible without degradation, aliasing, or loss of detail at any resolution.

### 4. Composition
-   **Centering:** Logos are typically centrally aligned within their designated clear space or artboard, ensuring visual stability and balance. For combination marks, the symbol and wordmark are balanced horizontally or vertically around a common optical center.
-   **Padding:** A minimum clear space, or "exclusion zone," must surround the logo. This padding should be proportional to the logo's size, typically no less than 0.5x or 1x the height of a dominant element (e.g., the letter 'X' in the wordmark or the core symbol unit). This ensures visual separation and prominence.
-   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** A strong, unambiguous figure-ground relationship is maintained, often achieved through high contrast. The primary logo elements form a clear figure against a simpler ground. Negative space is deliberately designed and contributes to the overall form and balance.

### 5. Avoid
-   Organic, fluid, cursive, or highly embellished letterforms and symbols.
-   Hand-drawn, sketch-like, painterly, or watercolor rendering styles.
-   Complex gradients, photographic textures, drop shadows, inner shadows, bevels, embossing, or other three-dimensional rendering effects.
-   Illustrative, figurative, or highly detailed imagery; anything resembling a mascot or caricature.
-   Multiple decorative typefaces, or any typography that is not geometric sans-serif or slab serif.
-   Asymmetrical compositions lacking a clear geometric rationale or optical balance.
-   Low contrast color combinations that hinder legibility or visual impact.
-   Inconsistent line weights, varying corner radiuses, or arbitrary element sizing.

## For PATTERNS:

### 1. Motif Rules
-   **Dominant Motif Types:** Patterns are constructed from abstract geometric shapes, often derived directly from the core geometry or angularity of the brand's logo. Examples include squares, rectangles, triangles, precise diagonal lines, polygon segments, or highly simplified architectural forms (e.g., rooflines, window grids). Motifs are simplified to their most elemental forms, ensuring clarity and repeatability.
-   **Geometric Principles:** Motifs adhere to strict geometric construction, utilizing straight lines and precise angles (e.g., 45, 90, 60 degrees). Repetition, mirroring, and rotational symmetry are primary methods for developing the motifs and their arrangement. Motifs are often modular, built from smaller, identical geometric units.

### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact
-   The pattern should convey a sense of order, structure, and sophisticated precision. It imbues the brand with qualities of reliability, stability, and modern elegance. The overall mood is calm, understated, and professional, reflecting a premium and thoughtful aesthetic suitable for real estate and architectural contexts.

### 3. Grid System
-   **Tiling Method:** Patterns typically employ a square or rectangular tiling grid system. Motifs are arranged in a predictable, repetitive sequence, often aligned to a staggered (brick), offset, or regular grid. Diagonal grids are acceptable if geometrically precise.
-   **Spacing:** Consistent, uniform spacing between individual motifs and repeating tile units is mandatory. This spacing is often derived from a base unit, ensuring visual rhythm and breathability. Overly dense or sparse patterns are avoided.
-   **Density:** Moderate to low density. The pattern should have ample negative space, allowing the motifs to breathe and preventing visual clutter. The emphasis is on elegant repetition rather than overwhelming coverage.

### 4. Style Constraints
-   **Rendering:** Flat, two-dimensional. No implied depth, perspective, or texture within the individual motifs. Each motif is rendered with sharp, clean lines and solid fills.
-   **Color Usage:** Monochromatic, duotone, or a highly restrained palette of two to three complementary or analogous colors. High contrast between the motif and background color is preferred to ensure distinctness.
-   **Complexity:** Low. Motifs are simple and easily identifiable. The complexity arises from the systematic arrangement and repetition, not from intricate details within the motifs themselves.

### 5. Tiling Technical
-   **Edge Alignment:** All motifs must align perfectly at the edges of the repeating tile unit. When tiled, the pattern must create continuous forms and seamless transitions across tile boundaries, both horizontally and vertically.
-   **Seamless Requirements:** The pattern must be perfectly tileable. There should be no visible seams, breaks, or abrupt changes when the pattern is repeated to cover an infinite plane. Elements that extend beyond one edge of the tile must reappear precisely on the opposite edge.

### 6. Avoid
-   Organic, freeform, or irregular motifs that lack geometric precision.
-   Figurative, illustrative, or photorealistic motifs.
-   Gradients, shadows, textures, or bevels within the motifs.
-   Overly busy, high-density patterns that lack sufficient negative space.
-   Clashing, highly saturated, or overly vibrant color combinations.
-   Patterns that appear hand-drawn, distressed, or aged.
-   Non-repeating or arbitrary asymmetrical pattern layouts.
