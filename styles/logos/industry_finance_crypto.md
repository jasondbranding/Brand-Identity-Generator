### For LOGOS:
#### Form Language
*   **Dominant Forms**: Primary reliance on perfect geometric primitives including circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, precise straight lines, and mathematically defined curves. All forms must be vector-based.
*   **Geometric Construction**: Logos are constructed using foundational geometric principles. This includes implicit or explicit grid systems, modular units, and adherence to classical ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:1.618 Golden Ratio, or simple whole-number proportional relationships).
*   **Technique Application**: Essential techniques are `overlap`, `symmetry`, and the intelligent use of `counter forms` (negative space). Overlapping elements should create new, distinct shapes or depth. Symmetry can be axial, radial, or translational. Counter forms must be deliberate and contribute positively to the logo's legibility and aesthetic.
*   **Form Types**: `Combination marks` (symbol + wordmark) are the preferred default. Stand-alone `symbol marks` and `wordmarks` are acceptable provided they rigorously adhere to the geometric and minimal principles. Abstract symbols derived from or suggestive of geometric construction are highly encouraged.
*   **Avoid**: Organic, freehand, irregular, or naturally-inspired shapes. Complex illustrative forms, skeuomorphic representations, or anthropomorphic elements. Forms lacking a clear underlying geometric structure.

#### Style Constraints
*   **Rendering Style**: Predominantly `flat` vector graphics with solid, untextured fills. Visual elements should be sharp and clearly defined.
*   **Dimensionality**: A `modern` aesthetic with a preference for 2D presentation. Subtle dimensionality can be introduced through clever `overlap` or simple planar folds (e.g., implied paper folds, ribbon effects) rather than complex 3D rendering, gradients, or shadows.
*   **Fill vs. Outline**: Logos primarily utilize solid `fills`. `Monoline` (uniform stroke weight outline) rendering is an acceptable alternative for symbol marks, provided the lines are continuous, clean, and maintain a consistent optical weight.
*   **Complexity Level**: `Minimal` complexity is paramount. Logos should be immediately recognizable and easily digestible. Avoid intricate details that disappear at smaller scales.
*   **Color Application**: `Duo-tone` or `tri-tone` color schemes are preferred, utilizing `vibrant` and/or `warm` color palettes. Colors must be applied as distinct, solid blocks to create `high-contrast` distinction between elements.
*   **Avoid**: Heavy gradients, photorealistic textures, drop shadows (unless extremely subtle and functional for overlap), bevels, embossing, or other ornate stylistic treatments. Highly decorated or antiquated design aesthetics.

#### Technical Specs
*   **Stroke Weights**: If outlines are used (e.g., monoline symbols), stroke weights must be uniform and optically balanced for the intended scale. For example, a minimum stroke width of 2 pixels at small display sizes, proportionally scaling up. Internal and external strokes must have a consistent visual weight.
*   **Proportions**: Strict adherence to proportional systems. Key elements should relate to each other through defined geometric ratios. For instance, the height of a symbol might be `1.618x` the cap height of the wordmark, or spacing defined by `x`-height units.
*   **Spacing & Kerning**: Generous and consistent `negative space` is critical. Internal spacing within symbols, as well as character spacing (kerning) and word spacing for wordmarks, must be optically balanced, clean, and provide ample room for legibility. Clear space around the entire logo should be a minimum of `1x` the height of a primary logo element (e.g., symbol height or cap height of wordmark).
*   **Scalability**: All logo elements must be designed as infinitely scalable vector graphics. They must maintain their integrity, clarity, and visual impact across all possible applications, from favicon to billboard. Sharpness and detail must be preserved without aliasing or pixelation.
*   **Avoid**: Uneven or inconsistent stroke weights. Arbitrary spacing or proportions. Designs that lose detail or become illegible at small sizes, or appear distorted at large sizes.

#### Composition
*   **Centering**: The logo, or its primary visual weight, must be perfectly `centered` within its designated clear space or artboard. For combination marks, the symbol and wordmark should be harmoniously aligned (e.g., vertically centered to each other, or left-aligned within a defined area).
*   **Padding/Clear Space**: A generous and clearly defined `clear space` (padding) must surround the logo. This space ensures visual isolation and impact. Minimum clear space should be proportional to a significant logo element, typically `1x` the height of the symbol or the cap height of the wordmark.
*   **Figure-Ground Ratio**: A strong, clear `figure-ground relationship` is required. The primary logo elements (figure) must stand out distinctly from the background (ground). The intentional use of `counter forms` should enhance this distinction, making negative space an active part of the design.
*   **Balance**: Achieve perfect optical balance and stability. Elements should be distributed to create a sense of equilibrium, often through `symmetry` or dynamic asymmetry within a structured framework.
*   **Avoid**: Logos that are off-center or poorly aligned. Insufficient clear space that causes the logo to feel cramped or interact poorly with other elements. Weak figure-ground relationships where the logo blends into the background. Imbalanced compositions that feel unstable or haphazard.

#### Avoid
*   **Illustrative Complexity**: Hand-drawn, highly detailed, or photographic elements.
*   **Skeuomorphism**: Realistic textures, reflections, gradients mimicking real-world materials (e.g., glass, metal, wood).
*   **Ornate Typography**: Serif typefaces that are not explicitly modern or geometric in their execution (e.g., highly decorative scripts, traditional serifs).
*   **Low Contrast**: Color combinations that do not provide clear differentiation between elements.
*   **Rasterization**: Non-vectorized elements that pixelate or degrade upon scaling.
*   **Chaotic Arrangements**: Random placement of elements, lack of implied grid or structure.
*   **Soft Edges**: Blurred edges, feathering, or anti-aliasing artifacts where sharp, defined lines are expected.

### For PATTERNS:
#### Motif Rules
*   **Dominant Motif Types**: Motifs must consist of simple, geometric forms such as lines, circles, squares, triangles, or abstract shapes derived directly from the logo's core geometry.
*   **Geometric Principles**: All motifs must adhere to geometric construction. `Symmetry` (radial, axial, translational) and `overlap` are critical in motif creation, generating visually harmonious and dynamic compositions.
*   **Source Derivation**: Motifs should ideally be a simplified, abstracted, or repeated element directly from the primary logo symbol or wordmark, maintaining brand recognition.
*   **Implied Direction/Movement**: Motifs can utilize angles, diagonal lines, or iterative forms to create a sense of `dynamic` flow and energy.
*   **Avoid**: Organic, natural, figurative, or highly complex motifs. Motifs that are purely decorative without a geometric foundation or connection to the brand's core identity.

#### Emotional & Personality Impact
*   **Brand Energy**: The pattern should exude a `confident` and `powerful` presence through its structured order and deliberate design.
*   **Accessibility & Modernity**: It should feel `accessible` due to its clean lines and straightforward geometric forms, reflecting a `modern` and forward-thinking attitude.
*   **Dynamic Vibe**: The arrangement of motifs should contribute to a `dynamic` and engaging visual experience, suggesting movement, progress, or connectivity without being chaotic.
*   **Avoid**: Patterns that feel chaotic, childish, overly whimsical, overtly aggressive, or static and uninspiring. Patterns conveying traditional elegance (unless geometrically reinterpreted) or excessive softness.

#### Grid System
*   **Tiling Method**: Patterns are constructed upon precise `grid systems`. This can include regular square grids, rectangular grids, isometric grids, or diagonal grids. The chosen grid dictates the placement and orientation of motifs.
*   **Spacing**: Consistent and precise `spacing` between motifs is paramount. This spacing should be derived proportionally from the motif size or grid units, ensuring visual rhythm and order. Avoid arbitrary or uneven gaps.
*   **Density**: Patterns can range from sparse, minimalist arrangements to moderately dense, tightly packed repetitions. The density should be controlled to ensure the pattern acts as an enhancing background element, not an overwhelming one.
*   **Modular Construction**: Patterns should appear `modular`, constructed from repeatable units that fit together seamlessly.
*   **Avoid**: Random or free-form placement of motifs. Irregular or inconsistent spacing. Patterns that are either excessively sparse to the point of being non-existent, or so dense they create visual noise.

#### Style Constraints
*   **Rendering**: `Flat`, vector-based rendering with solid fills. No gradients (unless subtle, controlled, and geometrically defined), textures, or photographic elements.
*   **Color Usage**: Primarily `duo-tone` or `tri-tone` palettes, using `vibrant` or `warm` colors. `High-contrast` color combinations are essential for clarity and visual impact. Colors should be applied in clean blocks.
*   **Complexity**: `Low to medium` complexity. The pattern should be easily readable and recognizable without requiring close inspection. Its primary function is to provide a consistent brand texture.
*   **Outline Usage**: `Monoline` patterns, utilizing a uniform stroke weight, are an acceptable variation for subtle backgrounds or textural elements, provided they maintain geometric precision.
*   **Avoid**: Multi-color palettes (beyond three primary colors) that detract from high-contrast principles. Overly complex or intricate patterns that compete with primary content. Blurred elements, soft edges, or effects that suggest rasterization.

#### Tiling Technical
*   **Edge Alignment**: All motifs and elements within the pattern must align perfectly at the `tiling edges`. This ensures a flawless transition when the pattern is repeated.
*   **Seamless Requirements**: The pattern must be `infinitely repeatable` in both horizontal and vertical directions without any visible seams, breaks, or disruptions in the visual flow. The tiling unit should dissolve into the overall pattern.
*   **Scalability**: Patterns must be designed as `scalable vector graphics` to ensure they render crisply and uniformly across all sizes and applications without degradation.
*   **Repeat Unit**: Define a clear `repeat unit` (tile) that can be effortlessly duplicated to form the larger pattern. This unit should be as compact and efficient as possible.
*   **Avoid**: Patterns that create visible seams or breaks when tiled. Non-vector based patterns that pixelate or distort on scaling. Patterns where the repeat unit is not clearly defined or creates optical anomalies.

#### Avoid
*   **Organic/Illustrative Patterns**: Freeform, natural, or hand-drawn patterns.
*   **Abstract Expressionism**: Patterns that are overtly painterly, chaotic, or lack clear geometric structure.
*   **Photographic/Textured**: Use of actual photographs, complex textures (e.g., concrete, wood grain), or heavily rendered elements.
*   **Low Clarity/Contrast**: Patterns that blend into the background due to insufficient contrast or cluttered design.
*   **Skeuomorphism**: Patterns mimicking real-world materials with shading and depth.
*   **Busy/Distracting**: Patterns that are too dense, colorful, or complex, detracting from any overlaid content.
