## For LOGOS:

### 1. Form Language
*   **Dominant Shapes:** Primarily organic, curvilinear, and flowing forms. Emphasize natural silhouettes, such as stylized botanical leaves, abstract flora, and smooth, wave-like structures. Shapes should possess soft, rounded edges and avoid sharp angularity.
*   **Geometry Rules:** Construction should prioritize continuous curves and naturalistic asymmetry. While elements may be simplified, they must retain an inherent organic quality. Implicit use of the golden ratio or other natural proportioning systems is encouraged for harmonious overall balance, even if individual components are asymmetrical.
*   **Construction Principles:** Logos are built from simplified, distinct elements. Components may overlap to create depth or an interlocking effect, but individual forms must remain clearly legible. Focus on the essential silhouette of a natural form rather than detailed rendering.

### 2. Style Constraints
*   **Rendering Style:** Predominantly flat graphic style, minimalist in presentation. Focus on solid color fills or consistent outlines. Subtle textural overlays (e.g., fine grain, soft brushstroke effect as seen in Reference #1 or #5) are permissible to add depth, but photo-realism or complex gradients are prohibited.
*   **Fill vs Outline:** Both solid fills and distinct outlines are acceptable. Often, a combination of filled and outlined elements is used to create visual interest within a duo-tone or muted palette. Outline weights must be consistent within a single logo.
*   **Complexity Level:** Low to moderate. Logos should be immediately recognizable and impactful. Avoid intricate details that compromise legibility or scalability. The design should rely on strong form rather than excessive embellishment.

### 3. Technical Specs
*   **Stroke Weights:** For outlined logos or elements, stroke weights should be uniform and robust enough to ensure legibility at small sizes. A typical range is 1/12 to 1/18 of the smallest dimension of the logo's bounding box.
*   **Proportions:** Elements should be proportioned naturally, reflecting the organic subject matter. Avoid uniform scaling for all components; instead, establish a visual hierarchy where primary elements are dominant and secondary elements provide support or detail.
*   **Spacing:** Sufficient negative space must be maintained around and within logo elements to ensure clarity and avoid visual clutter. Minimum clear space around any element should be equivalent to at least one primary stroke weight.
*   **Scalability:** Logos must be infinitely scalable without loss of detail or integrity. Vector-based construction is mandatory.

### 4. Composition
*   **Centering:** While often centrally balanced for stability, compositions can lean towards an organically asymmetrical arrangement, provided overall visual balance is maintained. Avoid strict geometric centering if it inhibits natural flow.
*   **Padding:** A minimum clear space around the logo, equal to 1x the cap height of any accompanying logotype or 1/4 the height of the primary graphic element, should be maintained.
*   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** A balanced ratio where neither the positive form nor the negative space overwhelmingly dominates. Aim for a distinct separation, often a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio of active element to negative space to ensure clarity.

### 5. Avoid (LOGOS)
*   Sharp geometric forms, rigid lines, or perfect mathematical shapes (e.g., squares, equilateral triangles, perfect circles unless within an organic context).
*   Photorealistic rendering, complex multi-color gradients, or prominent 3D effects (e.g., bevels, drop shadows with high offset/blur).
*   Overly intricate details that would pixelate or become illegible at small scales.
*   Mirror-image symmetry that appears unnatural or artificial.
*   Cluttered compositions lacking clear hierarchy or sufficient negative space.
*   Vibrant, high-saturation, or clashing color palettes.

### For PATTERNS:

### 1. Motif Rules
*   **Dominant Motif Types:** Stylized botanical leaves (8%), overlapping wavy lines (4%), overlapping leaf shapes (4%), abstract floral elements (4%). Motifs are primarily organic, inspired by natural forms. They are often simplified, either as silhouettes (Reference #1, #4) or clean outlines (Reference #2, #5), sometimes with subtle textural treatment (Reference #1, #3, #5).
*   **Geometric Principles:** Driven by curvilinear forms and natural shapes. Asymmetry is a key characteristic (40%) in the individual motifs and their overall arrangement. Repetition (40%) of these organic forms is fundamental, but often in a non-uniform or staggered manner rather than a rigid grid. Overlap (20%) of motifs is a common technique to create depth and dynamism.

### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact
*   **Calm (17%), Serene (17%), Natural (17%), Welcoming (17%), Earthy (8%):** The pattern evokes a sense of tranquility and connection to the natural world.
*   **Psychological Brand Energy:** Creates an impression of understated elegance, quiet confidence, and harmonious simplicity. It projects a soft, gentle, and approachable brand character.
*   **Vibe:** Gentle, harmonious, subtly sophisticated, and inviting. The overall feel is one of comfort and organic beauty, devoid of harshness or aggressive energy.

### 3. Grid System
*   **Tiling Method:** Predominantly based on irregular repetition, scattered arrangements (Reference #2, #5), or organic, flowing distributions (Reference #1, #3). While an underlying implied grid may guide general density, individual motifs are rarely confined to rigid, equally spaced cells. Staggered repetition and rotational variations are common.
*   **Spacing:** Variable spacing between motifs is preferred to enhance the organic feel. Avoid uniform, machine-like distances. Density ranges from sparse (e.g., Reference #2, #5) to moderately dense (e.g., Reference #1, #4), ensuring motifs are legible and the overall pattern doesn't become overly cluttered. Negative space is an active design element.
*   **Density:** Maintain a balance that allows motifs to breathe while creating a cohesive visual field. Avoid extreme sparseness that makes the pattern look unfinished or extreme density that creates visual noise.

### 4. Style Constraints
*   **Rendering:** Primarily organic (48%), abstract (16%), flat (13%), and rounded (6%), with a modern sensibility (6%). The style is graphic and simplified, favoring solid fills or consistent outlines. Subtle textures (e.g., paper texture, soft brushstroke, fine line hatching) are acceptable as an overlay, but avoid photorealism, detailed rendering, or complex gradients.
*   **Color Usage:** Restricted palettes, typically duo-tone (22%) or tri-tone. Colors are predominantly light (22%), muted (22%), or earth-tone (11%), occasionally with a dark (11%) accent or background. High-contrast or vibrant color combinations are avoided in favor of harmonious, low-saturation schemes.
*   **Complexity:** Low to moderate for individual motifs. The pattern's complexity arises from the arrangement, overlap, and interaction of these simple elements, rather than from intricate detail within each motif.

### 5. Tiling Technical
*   **Edge Alignment:** All elements that cross any of the four tile boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) must seamlessly align and reappear on the opposite side of the tile.
*   **Seamless Requirements:** The pattern must be perfectly seamless, creating an infinite, unbroken visual flow when tiled horizontally and vertically. There should be no visible breaks, harsh cut-offs, or discontinuities at the tile edges.
*   **Repeat Units:** The repeat unit should be expertly constructed to obscure its boundaries, ensuring the pattern appears continuous and non-repeating to the casual observer.

### 6. Avoid (PATTERNS)
*   Sharp, angular, or strictly geometric motifs (e.g., chevrons, checkerboards, rigid stripes, triangles) that lack organic curvature.
*   Highly saturated, neon, or primary color palettes.
*   Photorealistic images, highly detailed illustrations, or complex shadow/light rendering.
*   Symmetrical grid-based repetition without natural variation or asymmetry.
*   Visible seams, harsh cut-offs, or abrupt breaks at the pattern's tile boundaries.
*   Overly busy compositions that lack adequate negative space or clear motif separation.
*   Motifs that are overtly mechanical, industrial, or digitally artificial.
*   Heavy drop shadows, bevels, or strong 3D extrusion effects.
