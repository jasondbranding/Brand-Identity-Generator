### For LOGOS:

#### 1. Form Language
- **Dominant Shapes:** Logos are constructed primarily from fundamental geometric primitives: perfect circles, squares, rectangles, triangles (equilateral or right-angled), semicircles, and quarter circles. Abstract curvilinear forms, derived from smooth arcs or simple, consistent undulations, are also acceptable.
- **Geometry Rules:** All shapes must adhere to precise mathematical geometry. Corners are either sharply defined (90-degree angles) or uniformly rounded with consistent radii (e.g., quarter-circle fillets). Curves must be smooth and continuous, typically generated from segments of perfect circles.
- **Construction Principles:** Logos are often modular, composed of multiple distinct geometric elements combined or overlaid. Elements can interlock, abut, or exist in carefully balanced proximity, forming a cohesive visual whole. Negative space is actively utilized to define contours or imply secondary shapes, contributing to the overall design.

#### 2. Style Constraints
- **Rendering Style:** Predominantly flat graphic rendering. Logos must eschew gradients, shadows (including drop shadows, inner shadows), bevels, or any volumetric 3D effects. Surfaces are characterized by solid, uniform color fills.
- **Fill vs Outline:** Logos can be rendered as solid-filled shapes, uniform outlines, or a combination of both. When outlines are used, their stroke weight must be consistent across all elements within a single logo.
- **Complexity Level:** Low to moderate complexity. Logos should be instantly recognizable and easily reproducible. They typically consist of 2-5 primary geometric components, avoiding intricate details or micro-elements that compromise scalability.

#### 3. Technical Specs
- **Stroke Weights:** If outlines are incorporated, stroke weights must be uniform and robust enough to maintain integrity at small scales. A recommended minimum stroke weight to overall logo height ratio is 1:30, ideally closer to 1:20 for prominent outlines.
- **Proportions:** Maintain harmonious internal proportions. Individual geometric shapes (circles, squares) should be geometrically perfect. Overall logo dimensions often adhere to simple aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1, 4:3, 16:9 for wordmarks).
- **Spacing:** Adequate and consistent spacing between internal elements is crucial for legibility. A minimum clear space around the logo equivalent to at least the height of its smallest significant internal element should be maintained.
- **Scalability:** Logos must be designed as vector graphics, ensuring infinite scalability without loss of clarity or introduction of pixelation. Details must remain crisp and distinct at both very small and very large reproductions.

#### 4. Composition
- **Centering:** The primary logo mark should appear horizontally and vertically centered within its designated bounding box or clear space. Internal elements may exhibit balanced asymmetry but contribute to overall visual equilibrium.
- **Padding:** A generous clear space, or padding, must surround the logo. This clear space should be no less than 1/2 of the logo's full height or width, ideally 1 full unit of the logo's bounding box dimension, to ensure visual isolation.
- **Figure-Ground Ratio:** A clear and strong distinction between the logo's elements (figure) and the surrounding negative space (ground) is required. The negative space should actively contribute to the form and legibility, rather than being a passive background.

#### 5. Avoid
- **Avoid:** Gradients (linear, radial, or angular), drop shadows, bevels, embossing, or other simulated 3D effects.
- **Avoid:** Highly detailed, intricate, or photorealistic illustrations.
- **Avoid:** Irregular, organic, hand-drawn, or gestural shapes that lack geometric precision, unless specifically abstracted into simple, consistent curves.
- **Avoid:** Thin, inconsistent, or tapered stroke weights that may disappear at small scales.
- **Avoid:** Muted, desaturated, or monochromatic color palettes unless vibrancy is intentionally achieved through contrast.
- **Avoid:** Serif typefaces or overly decorative fonts if text is part of the logo.

### For PATTERNS:

1.  **Motif Rules**
    *   **Dominant Motif Types**: Patterns are built from a diverse collection of abstract geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, semicircles, regular polygons) and abstract doodle shapes (wavy lines, squiggles, zigzags, curved segments, simple crosses, plus signs, dots, dashes). Representational motifs, if used (e.g., fruit, flowers), must be rendered in a highly abstracted, simplified geometric style.
    *   **Geometric Principles**: All motifs adhere to strict geometric construction. Curves are smooth and derived from circular arcs; lines are straight and often align to horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree axes. Motifs can be solid-filled or consist of uniform outlines. Consistency in element proportion and line weight across repetitions is paramount.

2.  **Emotional & Personality Impact**
    *   **Vibe**: Creates a dynamic, optimistic, and lively atmosphere. The patterns evoke feelings of playfulness, energy, and nostalgia, referencing the aesthetic of 1980s Memphis Group design. They should feel welcoming, vibrant, stimulating, and designed to impart a sense of joy and visual intrigue.
    *   **Psychological Brand Energy**: Conveys a brand energy that is creative, modern, and approachable, with a distinctive sense of fun and artistic expression. It suggests an innovative spirit that isn't overly serious.

3.  **Grid System**
    *   **Tiling Method**: Patterns frequently employ a systematic grid construction, often a square or rectangular grid, for the placement and organization of motifs or modular units. Both regular, repeating grids and more dynamic, asymmetric arrangements of elements within a structured overall framework are utilized. Random scattering of motifs is acceptable if density is controlled.
    *   **Spacing**: When a grid is used, spacing between motif units should be consistent. For scattered patterns, ensure ample negative space surrounds individual motifs to prevent visual clutter and maintain distinctness. Spacing should typically be equal to or greater than the dimensions of the smaller motifs.
    *   **Density**: Medium to high density. The pattern field is well-populated with motifs, but sufficient clear space is preserved to allow individual elements to breathe. Aim for a figure-ground ratio where motifs occupy approximately 40-60% of the visual surface area.

4.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering**: Strictly flat, two-dimensional graphic style. No gradients, drop shadows, inner shadows, bevels, embossing, or realistic textures. All motifs are presented with solid, unmodulated color fills or uniform stroke outlines.
    *   **Color Usage**: Multi-color and vibrant palettes are standard. Colors should be distinct, often high-contrast, and contribute to an energetic visual impact. While light and warm hues are common, the overall palette must exhibit strong saturation and vibrancy. Each distinct motif element typically uses a single, solid color.
    *   **Complexity**: Moderate. Patterns feature a mix of several distinct motif types (typically 3-7 variations). The complexity emerges from the dynamic arrangement, repetition, and interaction of these relatively simple elements, rather than from intricate individual motif designs.

5.  **Tiling Technical**
    *   **Edge Alignment**: Patterns must be designed to be perfectly tileable horizontally and vertically. This ensures that when multiple pattern units are placed side-by-side, no visible seams, breaks, or discontinuities occur.
    *   **Seamless Requirements**: Any motif or graphic element that intersects an edge of the pattern tile must continue precisely on the opposite edge. This creates an illusion of infinite, continuous flow without abrupt cut-offs.

6.  **Avoid**
    *   Photorealistic or highly rendered illustrations, complex realistic textures, or organic motifs that are not geometrically abstracted.
    *   Subtle gradients, complex shading, or skeuomorphic rendering techniques.
    *   Dull, desaturated, or overly monochromatic color palettes that lack vibrancy and contrast.
    *   Overly thin, inconsistent, or fluctuating line weights for outlined motifs.
    *   Patterns that appear excessively cluttered, overly dense, or lacking sufficient negative space.
    *   Irregular, non-repeating layouts that do not offer clear tiling capabilities.
    *   Motifs that are excessively intricate or detailed, as this detracts from the playful visual impact.
