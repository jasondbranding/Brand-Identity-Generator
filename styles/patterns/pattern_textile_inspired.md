### For LOGOS:
1.  **Form Language**
    *   **Dominant shapes**: Logos integrate a duality of organic and geometric forms. Organic forms are characterized by fluid, curvilinear paths, graceful undulations, and natural, free-flowing contours. Geometric forms utilize precise straight lines, sharp angles, regular polygons (especially squares and zig-zags), and strict modularity. Abstract interpretations of both organic and geometric elements are common.
    *   **Geometry rules**: Organic elements follow principles of natural growth and rhythm, avoiding perfect symmetry unless deliberately integrated. Geometric elements adhere to a grid system, employing orthogonal or 45-degree diagonal alignments. Construction often features nesting (e.g., concentric squares), interlocking elements, or rhythmic repetition of a core motif.
    *   **Construction principles**: Logos are constructed using distinct positive and negative space. Forms can be solid, silhouette-based, or composed of clear, robust outlines. Underlying conceptual grids are often implied for geometric stability, even when forms are organic. Elements may appear to be carved or cut out, emphasizing their foundational shape.

2.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering style**: Predominantly flat graphic illustration, vector-based. Textural overlays (e.g., subtle grain, stipple, distressed effects, woven appearance) may be applied uniformly across solid fills or outlines, but the underlying form remains sharp and defined. No photographic realism or 3D rendering.
    *   **Fill vs outline**: Logos can utilize solid fills, robust outlines, or a combination where outlines define a primary shape and fills provide secondary detail. When using outlines, stroke continuity and consistency are paramount. Fills are typically uniform or textured, not gradient-heavy.
    *   **Complexity level**: Moderate to low complexity. Logos are designed for immediate recognition and legibility across diverse applications. Core motifs are simple yet distinctive, avoiding excessive intricate detail.

3.  **Technical Specs**
    *   **Stroke weights**: When outlines are used, stroke weights are consistent and medium to thick (relative to the overall size of the logo), ensuring clear visibility at small scales. A minimum stroke-to-counter ratio of 1:2 is preferred.
    *   **Proportions**: Elements within the logo maintain harmonious proportions. Geometric logos often adhere to specific aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:1.618). Organic logos balance curves and weights to prevent visual imbalance.
    *   **Spacing**: Generous internal negative space (counters) and external clear space (padding) is mandatory to ensure clarity and prevent visual clutter. Elements are distinct, not overlapping unless intentionally designed for transparency or layering effect.
    *   **Scalability**: Logos must retain full legibility and visual integrity when scaled from very small (e.g., icon size) to very large (e.g., billboard size). This mandates vector construction and avoidance of pixel-dependent details.

4.  **Composition**
    *   **Centering**: Logos are typically centrally composed, or designed with a clear, singular focal point that draws the eye. Asymmetrical compositions, if used, must maintain visual balance and equilibrium.
    *   **Padding**: A minimum clear space equivalent to the height of the smallest significant element should surround the logo on all sides, acting as a protective boundary.
    *   **Figure-ground ratio**: A strong, unambiguous distinction between the logo's positive form (figure) and its surrounding negative space (ground) is essential. Negative space is often integral to the logo's definition.

5.  **Avoid**
    *   Complex gradients, reflections, or simulated 3D effects that hinder flat reproduction.
    *   Thin, hairline strokes or overly delicate details that disappear at small sizes.
    *   Ambiguous or amorphous shapes lacking clear form or purpose.
    *   Rasterized textures or effects that do not scale well.
    *   Overly ornate or decorative elements that detract from the core message.
    *   Photorealistic imagery or photographic elements.

### For PATTERNS:
1.  **Motif Rules**
    *   **Dominant motif types**: Patterns feature a blend of organic and geometric motifs. Organic motifs include flowing botanical elements (e.g., leaves, petals), abstract organic forms, and sinuous, wavy, or curvilinear lines, often mimicking natural textures like wood grain or water. Geometric motifs consist of repetitive angular shapes (e.g., zig-zags, diagonals, squares, tessellations) arranged with precision. Motifs can be representational or highly abstract.
    *   **Geometric principles**: Patterns are built on principles of repetition, translation, reflection, and rotation. Grids are foundational for geometric patterns, ensuring uniform spacing and alignment. Organic patterns, while less rigid, maintain a rhythmic flow and distribution of elements. Nested or layered elements create depth and complexity.

2.  **Emotional & Personality Impact**
    *   **Vibe**: Patterns evoke a sense of natural fluidity, serene calm, or dynamic energy. Organic patterns lean towards warmth, softness, and natural elegance. Geometric patterns convey structure, modernity, and subtle movement. The overall personality is grounded, authentic, and possibly handcrafted, yet sophisticated — supporting brands that are natural, artisanal, contemporary, or boldly artistic.

3.  **Grid System**
    *   **Tiling method**: Patterns primarily employ seamless tiling methods, including full-drop, half-drop, brick, or mirrored repeats. The underlying grid can be explicit for geometric designs or implicit for organic, guiding the flow and distribution of elements.
    *   **Spacing**: Spacing between motifs ranges from densely packed, high-frequency arrangements where elements touch or overlap slightly, to more open, sparse compositions with significant negative space. Consistency in spacing is key to the pattern's rhythm and perceived density.
    *   **Density**: Patterns exhibit variable density. Some are dense, all-over textures filling the entire canvas, while others feature fewer, larger motifs distributed across the background. The chosen density must be consistent throughout the pattern.

4.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering**: Flat vector graphics or stylized, textured vector graphics. Textures (e.g., halftone dots, grainy overlays, distressed edges, woven effects) are uniformly applied and integrated into the vector forms, not photographic. No realistic shading, perspective, or complex lighting.
    *   **Color usage**: Limited and deliberate color palettes, typically 2-4 distinct colors per pattern. Colors can be monochromatic, analogous, or contrasting. Strong figure-ground contrast is often employed. Colors should be described conceptually (e.g., muted earth tones, vibrant primaries, deep cool tones), not by specific hex codes, to maintain palette-agnosticism.
    *   **Complexity**: Moderate complexity. Motifs are distinct and recognizable, but can interlock, overlap, or form intricate arrangements without becoming visually chaotic. Patterns maintain legibility and aesthetic appeal at various scales.

5.  **Tiling Technical**
    *   **Edge alignment**: All motifs and elements must align perfectly across the four edges of the pattern tile. This ensures completely seamless repetition in all directions.
    *   **Seamless requirements**: There should be absolutely no visible seams, harsh cut-offs, or discontinuities at the tile boundaries. Elements crossing an edge must continue smoothly onto the opposite edge of the tile, giving the impression of an infinite, continuous surface.

6.  **Avoid**
    *   Non-repeating patterns or patterns with visible seams/breaks in the repeat.
    *   Complex gradients that disrupt the seamless nature of the pattern or appear as unstylized shifts in color.
    *   Photographic imagery or realistic textures that lack stylization.
    *   Overly detailed or chaotic compositions that lack a clear visual hierarchy or underlying structure.
    *   Patterns that appear to be rasterized or pixelated, especially at larger scales.
    *   Heavy drop shadows or complex lighting effects that break the flat, graphic aesthetic.
