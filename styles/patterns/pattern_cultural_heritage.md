### For LOGOS:

**1. Form Language**
*   **Dominant Shapes:** Primarily geometric forms such as diamonds, squares, triangles, octagons, chevrons, and rectilinear elements. Organic forms include stylized botanical elements (leaves, flowers, vines) and culturally inspired fauna (e.g., stylized birds, mammals, mythological creatures).
*   **Geometry Rules:** Construction often based on a strong underlying grid, with precise angles (e.g., 45, 90, 120 degrees) for geometric shapes. Organic forms should exhibit flowing, curvilinear characteristics while maintaining visual balance and internal symmetry (bilateral or radial) where appropriate. Elements may display a handcrafted, slightly irregular quality.
*   **Construction Principles:** Logos should be built from foundational geometric primitives or highly stylized organic elements. Emphasize modularity, repetition of core shapes, and interlocking elements, even when simplified. Utilize negative space effectively to define forms and ensure a clear figure-ground relationship.

**2. Style Constraints**
*   **Rendering Style:** Can range from flat, crisp vector graphics with solid fills to slightly textured or hand-drawn aesthetics that convey an authentic, artisanal feel. Detailed illustration with clear outlines and distinct color areas is also acceptable.
*   **Fill vs Outline:** Predominantly solid fills. Outlines, if present, should be distinct and substantial, often serving as primary defining strokes or contributing to a hand-drawn quality. Negative space can be used to imply forms without explicit outlines.
*   **Complexity Level:** Medium to high detail. Logos should feel rich and considered, not overly simplistic or minimalist. Intricate details must remain scalable and legible at various sizes.

**3. Technical Specs**
*   **Stroke Weights:** For outlined elements, stroke weights should be substantial, typically ranging from 1/12th to 1/8th of the element's overall height or width. Maintain consistent stroke weight within a single logo unless intentional variation (e.g., for a hand-drawn effect) is applied.
*   **Proportions:** Maintain harmonious proportions, often leveraging simple ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:1.618, 1:2) for core components. Ensure optical balance.
*   **Spacing:** Ample internal spacing to ensure clarity and avoid visual clutter, typically equal to or greater than the primary stroke weight. External padding around the logo should be at least 1/4th of the logo's smallest dimension.
*   **Scalability:** All logo elements must remain legible and impactful from small favicon sizes (16x16 pixels) to large-scale applications. Simplify detail where necessary for smaller scales while retaining core identity.

**4. Composition**
*   **Centering:** Logos should be optically centered within their allocated space, maintaining overall balance and stability.
*   **Padding:** Ensure a minimum clear space buffer around the logo, typically equal to the height of the largest letter in the accompanying logotype (if present), or 25% of the logo's shortest dimension.
*   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** Ensure a clear and strong figure-ground separation. The primary motif should be immediately identifiable against its background, regardless of complexity. Active use of negative space is encouraged.

**5. Avoid**
*   Abstract, non-representational, or amorphous forms lacking defined structure or cultural resonance.
*   Overly modern, industrial, sterile, or corporate aesthetics.
*   Thin, delicate, or hairline strokes that disappear at small scales or lack visual impact.
*   Complex gradient fills or photographic textures that reduce clarity and scalability.
*   Generic clip-art aesthetics or overly simplistic, uninspired forms lacking character.
*   Unbalanced or asymmetrical compositions unless intentionally stylized for a dynamic, culturally specific effect.
*   Purely illustrative, non-vector, or bitmap-dependent assets for primary logo marks.

### For PATTERNS:

1.  **Motif Rules**
    *   **Dominant Motif Types**: Geometric motifs include tribal bands, interlocking diamonds, squares, triangles, octagons, zig-zags, chevrons, and rectilinear maze-like patterns. Organic motifs include stylized folk florals (tulips, leaves, blossoms), detailed botanical elements (palm fronds, vines), and culturally inspired fauna (elephants, monkeys, peacocks).
    *   **Geometric Principles**: Extensive use of repetition, symmetry (translational, rotational, reflectional), tessellation (regular, semi-regular, irregular), and grid construction (square, rhombic, hexagonal). Elements often align to 45 or 90-degree angles.
    *   **Organic Principles**: Emphasize flowing curvilinear forms and naturalistic shapes, highly stylized to maintain pattern integrity. Symmetry is often present within individual motifs or in their overall arrangement. Motifs should interlock, connect, or layer harmoniously.

2.  **Emotional & Personality Impact**
    *   **Vibe**: Energetic, warm, welcoming, authentic, vibrant, captivating, and engaging, with a handmade or traditional artistic character. Conveys cultural richness, tradition, historical depth, and artisanal craftsmanship, evoking positive, inviting emotions and a connection to heritage.

3.  **Grid System**
    *   **Tiling Method**: Seamless repeating patterns are mandatory. Methods include all-over repeats, half-drop repeats, brick repeats, and mirror repeats. Strong emphasis on tessellating grids for geometric patterns where elements fit together perfectly without gaps.
    *   **Spacing**: Varies from densely packed, intricate designs where elements interlock closely (minimal negative space) to designs with medium density where motifs are clearly separated but contribute to an overall cohesive field. Avoid sparse arrangements with excessive negative space.
    *   **Density**: Predominantly medium to high density, ensuring the pattern feels full, rich, and visually satisfying across the surface.

4.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering**: Can be flat vector graphics with crisp edges and solid fills; or exhibit a slightly textured, hand-drawn, or imperfect quality that enhances authenticity; or present as detailed, multi-layered illustrations with subtle shading and implied texture.
    *   **Color Usage**: Palettes should be intentional and often high contrast. Duotone, tri-color, or multi-color schemes are acceptable. Colors should be rich, vibrant, and evocative of natural dyes or traditional art, rather than overly muted or desaturated.
    *   **Complexity**: Ranges from moderately complex modular patterns to intricately detailed, interlocking, or illustrative compositions. Layering of motifs and implied visual depth is encouraged.

5.  **Tiling Technical**
    *   **Edge Alignment**: All pattern elements must align perfectly at the edges of the repeating tile to ensure a flawless, uninterrupted pattern when tiled. No visible seams or breaks are permitted.
    *   **Seamless Requirements**: The pattern must infinitely repeat across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes without any discernible transition lines or cut-off elements, creating a continuous visual field.

6.  **Avoid**
    *   Abstract expressionism or purely digital/synthetic aesthetics lacking organic or geometric structure.
    *   Futuristic, overly minimalistic, or overly clinical designs.
    *   Harsh, cold, or desaturated color palettes that lack vibrancy or cultural warmth.
    *   Photo-realistic imagery or textures; stylized and illustrative textures are acceptable.
    *   Sparse compositions with large, empty areas or motifs too widely spaced.
    *   Visible tiling seams, misaligned elements, or inconsistent motif scaling in repeats.
    *   Generic stock art elements lacking a distinct cultural or artisanal character.
    *   Pixelated or low-resolution textures, unless intentionally stylized for a retro, hand-printed effect.
    *   Over-reliance on complex gradients or heavy shading that obscures motif clarity.
