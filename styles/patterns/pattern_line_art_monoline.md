# Style Guide

This document outlines the core visual language for generating brand assets, particularly logos and patterns, ensuring consistency with the established style derived from our reference collection. All generated assets must strictly adhere to these principles.

## For LOGOS:

### 1. Form Language
-   **Dominant Shapes**: Strictly geometric forms are primary. This includes perfect circles, precise arcs, straight lines, right angles, and rectangular or square constructs. Derived forms such as ovals, semicircles, and complex polygons should maintain clear geometric parentage.
-   **Geometry Rules**: Construction must be founded on a visible or implied mathematical grid system. Elements should exhibit logical relationships: concentricity, parallelism, perpendicularity, radial symmetry, axial symmetry, and precise intersection points. Use of classical proportion systems (e.g., golden ratio, 1:2, 1:1) is highly encouraged for harmonious composition.
-   **Construction Principles**: Logos are built from fundamental, often interlocking or overlapping, monoline segments. Complex forms arise from the rational arrangement of simpler geometric primitives. Modularity is key, where elements can be understood as repeatable units or logical extensions of a core module. The overall impression is one of engineered simplicity and clarity.

### 2. Style Constraints
-   **Rendering Style**: Clean, crisp vector line art. Lines must be sharp and anti-aliased to perfection, without any pixelation or blur. The aesthetic is purely digital and precise.
-   **Fill vs Outline**: Exclusively outline or stroke-based. No solid fills are to be used within the primary logo elements. Any enclosed spaces should be active negative space.
-   **Complexity Level**: Minimalist to moderate. Logos should convey meaning and identity through essential forms. Avoid excessive detail or intricate embellishments. Focus on strong silhouettes and clear form recognition.

### 3. Technical Specs
-   **Stroke Weights**: Predominantly monoline; maintain a consistent stroke weight throughout the primary graphical elements of a single logo. Where subtle emphasis is required, stroke weight variations should be minimal and adhere to a clear proportional system (e.g., 1:2 ratio for primary to secondary lines). A general guideline for primary strokes is 1-2% of the logo's bounding box dimension.
-   **Proportions**: All elements must adhere to rational, grid-based proportions. Maintain consistent ratios between line segments, radii of arcs, and spacing.
-   **Spacing**: Ensure ample and consistent negative space between graphic elements. Spacing should be proportional to the stroke weight or an established grid unit, ensuring visual balance and preventing visual clutter. Minimum clear space around a logo should be equivalent to `X`, where `X` is 0.5 times the height of the logo's bounding box.
-   **Scalability**: Logos must be infinitely scalable without loss of detail or integrity, appearing crisp and clear at all sizes from small favicons to large signage. Vector output is mandatory.

### 4. Composition
-   **Centering**: Primary graphical marks are typically centered within their display area, exhibiting perfect balance. Exceptions occur only when a strong, intentional asymmetrical grid-based composition is dictated.
-   **Padding**: Logos require a significant and consistent clear space (padding) around them, acting as a visual buffer. This clear space should be at least `X` units, where `X` is proportional to the logo's size, typically 1/4 to 1/2 of its shortest dimension.
-   **Figure-Ground Ratio**: A high contrast between the logo's lines (figure) and the background (ground) is essential. Negative space is an active and integral design component, contributing to the overall form and balance. Figures should occupy approximately 20-40% of the total available area.

### 5. Avoid
-   Gradients, drop shadows, inner shadows, bevels, embossing, or other simulated 3D effects.
-   Rough, hand-drawn, distressed, or pixelated textures.
-   Organic forms lacking strict geometric stylization (e.g., free-form curves, naturalistic illustrations).
-   Multiple, wildly varying stroke weights within primary logo elements.
-   Overly decorative, whimsical, or cartoonish aesthetics.
-   Complex photographic elements or raster images as core logo components.
-   Clashing, highly saturated, or fluorescent color palettes.
-   Unbalanced, non-grid-aligned, or chaotic compositions.

### For PATTERNS:

### 1. Motif Rules
-   **Dominant Motif Types**: Patterns are constructed primarily from flowing curved lines, geometric arcs, parallel arched lines, and rectilinear grids. Abstract botanical forms, if used, must be highly geometric and stylized, integrating seamlessly into the linear grid framework. Intersecting lines and forms are a common element.
-   **Geometric Principles**: All motifs must derive from strict geometric principles. Repetition (translation, rotation, reflection) of modular, fundamental geometric shapes (circles, arcs, lines, squares, rectangles) is paramount. Underlying grid construction dictates the placement and interaction of all pattern elements. Rhythmic progression of lines and forms should be evident.

### 2. Emotional & Personality Impact
-   **Emotional Impact**: The patterns should evoke feelings of sophistication, calm, thoughtfulness, and aspiration. They are designed to be visually serene and intellectually engaging.
-   **Brand Energy**: Conveys an identity that is elegant, refined, professional, and understatedly luxurious. It implies order, precision, and quality.
-   **Vibe**: Modern, clean, organized, harmonious, and premium. The aesthetic is one of deliberate design and curated simplicity.

### 3. Grid System
-   **Tiling Method**: Patterns must be designed for perfect, seamless repetition across an infinite plane. The base unit for tiling (tile cell) should be clearly defined, typically square or rectangular. The underlying grid system is the foundational structure for all element placement.
-   **Spacing**: Consistent and precise spacing between all pattern elements is crucial. This spacing should be directly related to the pattern's grid unit or stroke weight, maintaining visual harmony and avoiding visual crowding. Ample negative space is a deliberate design choice, contributing to the pattern's calm and sophisticated mood.
-   **Density**: Patterns should maintain a low to medium visual density. Elements should be distinct and not merge into an undifferentiated mass. The focus is on clarity of line and form, not on maximal visual information.

### 4. Style Constraints
-   **Rendering**: Monoline vector art. All lines must be crisp, clean, and mathematically precise, without any discernible texture or variation in digital output.
-   **Color Usage**: Strictly limited palettes: monochrome, light neutrals, earth-tones. Typically, a two-color scheme (line color against background color) is preferred. High contrast between line work and background is essential for legibility and visual impact. Color should enhance the pattern's geometric nature, not distract from it.
-   **Complexity**: Minimalist to moderate. The elegance lies in the simplicity and precision of lines and their arrangement, rather than intricate detail. Patterns should be easily readable and recognizable without excessive cognitive load.

### 5. Tiling Technical
-   **Edge Alignment**: All elements that reach the edge of the pattern tile must align perfectly with elements on the opposite edge when the tile is repeated. There must be no visible seams, breaks, or discontinuities.
-   **Seamless Requirements**: The pattern tile must be designed such that when it is replicated horizontally and vertically, it forms an unbroken, continuous design. Any element that exits one side of the tile must re-enter precisely on the opposing side, completing its form.

### 6. Avoid
-   Raster images, pixelated textures, or any non-vector elements.
-   Random, chaotic, or non-repeating designs.
-   Busy, cluttered, or overly dense compositions that lack clear negative space.
-   Inconsistent or wildly varying stroke weights within a single pattern.
-   Photorealistic elements, complex illustrations, or highly detailed naturalistic forms.
-   Bright, neon, highly saturated, or overly complex multi-color palettes.
-   Abstract expressionist, gestural, or hand-drawn aesthetics that lack geometric discipline.
-   Organic forms that do not adhere to a geometric abstraction or underlying grid.
