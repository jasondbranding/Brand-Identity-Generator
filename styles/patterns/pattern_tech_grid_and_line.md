### For LOGOS:
1.  **Form Language**
    *   **Dominant shapes:** Geometric primitives (squares, circles, lines, dots) are primary building blocks. Rectilinear forms are dominant, with curvilinear elements derived from or contained within grid structures. Forms often appear as segmented lines or arrays of discrete points.
    *   **Geometry rules:** Strict adherence to an underlying geometric framework. Elements must align to a precise grid or be constructed from mathematically defined angles (e.g., 0, 45, 90 degrees). Proportions should be exact and repeatable.
    *   **Construction principles:** Logos are constructed using modular grid systems or point-cloud arrays, implying a digital or data-driven origin. Elements often resemble wireframes, circuit traces, or digital visualizations. Asymmetry is employed intentionally to create dynamic tension within a balanced geometric composition. Optical illusions, perceived depth, or three-dimensionality can be achieved through pixel density variations, perspective shifts of grid lines, or a digital terrain grid effect.

2.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering style:** Clean, sharp, vector-like, or distinctly pixelated. Transitions for density or gradients should be smooth and subtle, or sharply segmented block-like. Wireframe or outline renderings are favored.
    *   **Fill vs outline:** Predominantly composed of outlines, segmented lines, or dense point fields. When filled, shapes are solid and opaque, or composed of uniformly sized, distinct pixels.
    *   **Complexity level:** Moderate to complex. Complexity arises from the intricate arrangement and interaction of numerous simple, repeated geometric elements, not from ornate individual components. Designs should feel sophisticated and analytical.

3.  **Technical Specs**
    *   **Stroke weights:** Consistent and uniform stroke weights within a single logo, typically fine to medium (e.g., 1px to 3px on a standard digital display resolution). Any variation in stroke weight must be minimal and intentional for visual hierarchy or depth.
    *   **Proportions:** Derived from precise aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1, 16:9) or based on a strict modular grid system (e.g., 8-point grid). Internal elements maintain consistent relative scaling.
    *   **Spacing:** Precise and uniform spacing between elements, dictated by the underlying grid system. Negative space is intentional and often forms secondary geometric shapes, acting as an integral part of the design.
    *   **Scalability:** Designed for extreme scalability. Details must remain clear and sharp across all sizes, from small icons to large format displays, favoring vector or pixel-perfect raster constructions.

4.  **Composition**
    *   **Centering:** Can be centrally aligned for stability or employ deliberate, calculated asymmetry to introduce dynamism. Balance should be visually apparent.
    *   **Padding:** Ample clear space surrounding the logo is mandatory, typically a minimum of 1/4 of the logo's bounding box width, to maintain strong visual separation and impact.
    *   **Figure-ground ratio:** High contrast between the logo elements (figure) and the background (ground). Figure elements are typically monochromatic or limited to a single accent color against a dark or light, untextured background.

5.  **Avoid**
    *   Organic, curvilinear, freeform, or hand-drawn shapes.
    *   Photographic or realistic textures, gradients, or materials.
    *   Sketched, grunge, distressed, or aged aesthetics.
    *   Multiple bright, clashing, or overly saturated colors.
    *   Heavy drop shadows, bevels, embossing, or excessive dimensionality that compromises geometric purity, unless part of a distinct wireframe or point-cloud rendering.
    *   Cartoonish, whimsical, or overtly decorative elements.
    *   Color gradients, unless specifically a monochrome luminance gradient for depth or a distinct pixel density gradient.
    *   Serif, script, or handwritten typography as integrated graphic elements.

### For PATTERNS:
1.  **Motif Rules**
    *   **Dominant motif types:** Repetitive arrays of precisely spaced dots, pixels, lines, or segmented lines. Halftone dot gradients, graduated segmented lines, varied pixel density, dynamic vertical lines, and pixelated cross dispersion are core motif types.
    *   **Geometric principles:** Strict geometric construction is paramount. Motifs are derived from and align to underlying grid systems, resulting in highly structured and organized arrangements. Diagonal lines at specific angles (e.g., 45 degrees) or perfect horizontal/vertical lines are common. Segmentation of lines or shapes into distinct, measurable units is a key characteristic.

2.  **Emotional & Personality Impact**
    *   **How the pattern feels:** Futuristic, analytical, sophisticated, mysterious, and complex. Conveys a strong sense of digital precision, data visualization, and advanced technology.
    *   **Psychological brand energy:** Intelligent, innovative, controlled, progressive, and efficient.
    *   **Vibe**: A modern, high-tech, and serious atmosphere, often with an underlying sense of calm and order due to its structured nature, even when incorporating optical illusions or dynamism.

3.  **Grid System**
    *   **Tiling method:** Seamless, modular tiling is required, typically based on square or rectangular grids. Elements must be precisely aligned to a foundational, invisible grid.
    *   **Spacing:** Uniform and consistent spacing between grid units or individual motif components. Any variations in spacing are deliberate and contribute to the optical effect, perceived depth, or density gradient.
    *   **Density:** Patterns frequently exhibit areas of varied density (e.g., sparse to dense pixel fields, thin to thick line arrays) to create gradients, visual interest, or abstract forms. Density changes should be gradual, segmented, or follow a mathematical progression.

4.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering:** Crisp, clean, pixel-perfect, or vector-based. No blurriness, aliasing artifacts, or unintentional rasterization effects (unless a distinct pixel art style is the explicit intent).
    *   **Color usage:** Predominantly monochrome (e.g., black and white, or shades of a single color) or a very limited palette (a single accent color against a dark background is common). High contrast between pattern elements and the background is essential. When an accent color is used, it should be a single, distinct, and often saturated but not overtly vibrant hue against a dark or neutral ground.
    *   **Complexity:** Moderate to high. Complexity is achieved through the intricate arrangement and interaction of many simple, repeated elements, rather than from ornate individual components. Optical illusions and implied depth contribute significantly to the perceived complexity.

5.  **Tiling Technical**
    *   **Edge alignment:** Perfect edge alignment is mandatory for seamless repetition. There must be no visible seams, breaks, or discontinuities in the pattern when tiled horizontally or vertically.
    *   **Seamless requirements:** The pattern must be infinitely repeatable across both axes without distortion or abrupt visual changes at the tile boundaries. Elements crossing tile edges must continue perfectly on the opposite side of the adjacent tile.

6.  **Avoid**
    *   Organic, curvilinear, free-flowing, or hand-drawn patterns that lack geometric rigor.
    *   Abstract expressionist, painterly, illustrative, or photorealistic styles.
    *   Pastel, muted, or highly diverse color palettes.
    *   Soft, diffused lighting, realistic shadows, or excessive volumetric effects.
    *   Distressed textures, crumpled paper effects, or representations of natural materials.
    *   Random, chaotic, or arbitrary arrangements without an underlying structural principle or grid.
    *   Patterns that lack a clear, repeating module or consistent geometric structure.
    *   Overtly playful, childish, or overly decorative motifs.
