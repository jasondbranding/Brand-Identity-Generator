### For LOGOS:

1.  **Form Language**
    *   **Dominant Shapes**: Strict geometric forms, predominantly rectilinear shapes such as squares and triangles, but significantly incorporating smooth curves, arcs, and rounded corners (e.g., ovals, pill shapes, interlocking C-curves). Faceted forms and sharp angles (e.g., equilateral triangles, rhombuses) are also prominent. Elements often suggest modularity and interlocking connections.
    *   **Geometry Rules**: Constructed on a precise underlying grid system. Forms adhere to exact angles, commonly multiples of 30, 45, or 90 degrees. Employs principles of symmetry (reflectional, rotational) and often incorporates implied optical illusions through line interplay or negative space.
    *   **Construction Principles**: Based on grid construction, modularity, and repetitive units or transformations of a base shape. Forms are often created by subtracting or joining simpler geometric primitives.

2.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering Style**: Strictly flat vector graphics. Clean, sharp, and precise edges. Absence of texture, gradients, or volumetric effects.
    *   **Fill vs Outline**: Primarily utilizes solid fills or clean outlines against a contrasting background. Duo-tone or a limited color palette (2-3 colors) is characteristic. Can combine solid filled elements with outlined components within a single logo.
    *   **Complexity Level**: Moderate to low complexity. Designs are inherently simple but can achieve visual intrigue through the intelligent arrangement and repetition of basic forms. Avoids excessive detail that would hinder scalability or recognition.

3.  **Technical Specs**
    *   **Stroke Weights**: Consistent stroke weights within a single logo. Primary strokes should range from 1/10 to 1/20 of the logo's smallest overall dimension. Secondary or internal lines, if present, should maintain a proportional relationship to primary strokes (e.g., half the weight).
    *   **Proportions**: Adheres to strict mathematical ratios (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 2:3, golden ratio) or simple integer divisions based on the underlying grid. All elements must align to the established grid.
    *   **Spacing**: Uniform spacing between elements or components. Negative space is a deliberate design element, often equal to or proportionally related to stroke weights or object sizes.
    *   **Scalability**: Must be infinitely scalable without degradation. Designed as vector art, maintaining clarity and integrity at all sizes from icon to billboard.

4.  **Composition**
    *   **Centering**: Logo elements must be visually and geometrically centered within a defined clear space or artboard.
    *   **Padding**: A minimum clear space around the logo equivalent to 1/4 of the logo's bounding box height or width (whichever is smaller) must be maintained.
    *   **Figure-Ground Ratio**: Balanced, ensuring both positive (figure) and negative (ground) space contribute to the overall readability and aesthetic, often using negative space to define secondary shapes.

5.  **Avoid**
    *   Organic, free-form, abstract expressionistic, or hand-drawn elements.
    *   Complex gradients, drop shadows, bevels, inner glows, or photographic textures.
    *   Asymmetrical or unbalanced compositions that lack a clear central axis or focal point.
    *   Excessive ornamentation, superfluous details, or clutter.
    *   Raster-based or pixelated aesthetics.
    *   More than three distinct colors.

### For PATTERNS:

1.  **Motif Rules**
    *   **Dominant Motif Types**: Exclusively geometric motifs. Strong emphasis on zig-zag lines (broken or continuous), stylized square grids (often with slight embellishments), faceted triangular star shapes, and especially intricate interlocking lattice structures which may feature both angular and smoothly curved elements. Motifs are modular and inherently repeatable.
    *   **Geometric Principles**: Strict adherence to fundamental geometric shapes and lines (straight lines, arcs, squares, triangles, polygons). Forms are derived from a foundational grid system. Principles of repetition, mirroring, rotation (e.g., 90, 180 degrees), and translation are paramount for motif development and arrangement. Angularity is prevalent, but smooth, consistent curves and rounded corners (as seen in interlocking patterns) are equally crucial.

2.  **Emotional & Personality Impact**
    *   **Vibe**: Energetic, dynamic, modern, bold, and with a futuristic sensibility. Conveys precision, structure, and a sophisticated rhythm. Can project elegance through intricate interlocking forms or a high-tech feel through sharp angles and strong contrast. Imparts a sense of organized movement and controlled vitality.

3.  **Grid System**
    *   **Tiling Method**: Employs seamless repeat tiling, ensuring infinite continuity. Common tiling methods include square repeat, brick repeat, and half-drop repeat. The underlying grid can be Cartesian, isometric, or based on specific geometric tessellations (e.g., hexagonal, triangular).
    *   **Spacing**: Consistent and calculated spacing between repeating motifs and internal elements. Negative space within the pattern often holds equal or proportionally related visual weight to the positive elements.
    *   **Density**: Patterns can range from sparsely distributed, minimal motifs (e.g., small repeating icons on a large field) to densely interwoven, complex structures. Visual density is controlled through motif size, line weight, and the ratio of positive to negative space. The pattern should never appear chaotic.

4.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering**: Flat vector graphics with sharp, clean lines and solid fills. No textural overlays, painterly effects, or photographic elements.
    *   **Color Usage**: Primarily duo-tone, featuring one dominant dark background color and one contrasting, often warm, foreground color. High visual contrast is essential. Limited to a maximum of 2-3 distinct colors per pattern instance. Colors should be described conceptually (e.g., "deep charcoal," "vibrant crimson," "pale ecru," "metallic bronze").
    *   **Complexity**: Moderate to high visual complexity resulting from the precise structural interplay of simple geometric forms and their intelligent repetition. Complexity arises from design ingenuity, not from an abundance of individual elements or overly intricate detail.

5.  **Tiling Technical**
    *   **Edge Alignment**: Perfect horizontal and vertical alignment of all pattern elements across tile boundaries. The design must seamlessly flow from one tile to the next on all four sides, creating a continuous, unbroken visual field.
    *   **Seamless Requirements**: The pattern tile must be constructed so that it repeats infinitely in all directions without any visible seams, disruptions, or breaks in the established rhythm or structure. Elements terminating at one edge must perfectly connect with their corresponding elements on the opposite edge of the tile.

6.  **Avoid**
    *   Organic, illustrative, or naturalistic motifs (e.g., flora, fauna, human figures, landscapes, abstract blobs).
    *   Gradients, drop shadows, transparency, soft edges, or 3D volumetric effects within the pattern elements.
    *   Chaotic, random, or asymmetrical arrangements that lack a clear underlying structure.
    *   More than three distinct colors within a single pattern instance.
    *   Pixelated or rasterized appearances, or elements that suggest low resolution.
    *   Vague or undefined edge transitions that disrupt seamless tiling.
    *   Low contrast color combinations that make motifs difficult to discern.
    *   Monochromatic patterns that lack sufficient visual separation between elements.
