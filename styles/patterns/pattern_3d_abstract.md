### For LOGOS:

1.  **Form Language**
    *   **Dominant Shapes:** Employ elegant, sweeping curves and fluid, organic geometries. Forms should exhibit an inherent sense of motion and volumetric depth. Incorporate layered curved planes or implied surfaces that suggest a continuous flow or a controlled spiral.
    *   **Geometry Rules:** Utilize parabolic and hyperbolic curves, often with an underlying rational spline structure to maintain precision. Avoid purely circular or angular forms. Organic elements should retain a sculptural, high-definition quality rather than soft, undefined amorphousness.
    *   **Construction Principles:** Logos are built on principles of implied light refraction and reflection, creating forms that appear to be self-illuminated or carved by light. Utilize negative space strategically to define edges and create secondary forms. Construction should imply a 3D object viewed from a specific, often dynamic, perspective, not a flat icon.

2.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering Style:** High-fidelity 3D rendering with advanced lighting and shading. Surfaces should possess a glossy, reflective, or iridescent quality. Emphasize smooth transitions and photorealistic material properties (e.g., polished metal, liquid glass).
    *   **Fill vs. Outline:** Primarily utilize solid fills with nuanced gradients and subtle internal reflections. Outlines are typically implied by strong light/shadow contrast or surface edges, rather than explicit strokes. When present, outlines should be thin, luminous lines that trace the contours of forms, often with a gradient fade.
    *   **Complexity Level:** Moderately complex, focusing on a single, compelling abstract form or intertwined forms that maintain legibility at various scales. Intricate details should contribute to perceived depth and surface quality, not clutter.

3.  **Technical Specs**
    *   **Stroke Weights:** When implied or explicit luminous lines are present, their perceived stroke weight should vary dynamically, ranging from 0.5px (finest) to 4px (broadest) at a standard resolution, emphasizing depth and perspective. Thicker strokes should recede or indicate proximity.
    *   **Proportions:** Aim for balanced asymmetry or dynamic symmetry. Elements should follow principles reminiscent of the Golden Ratio for harmonious proportions and visual flow, especially in curve transitions and layering. Aspect ratios of main elements should generally fall between 1:1 and 1:2 or 2:1.
    *   **Spacing:** Internal spacing between layered or interacting elements should be deliberate, creating discernible separation and allowing light to define each form. Minimum clear space around the logo should be no less than 0.5x the height of the logo's bounding box.
    *   **Scalability:** Forms must maintain their distinctiveness and visual impact across extreme scales, from small favicons to large display graphics. Gradient fidelity and surface reflectivity should remain consistent regardless of size.

4.  **Composition**
    *   **Centering:** Logos should be optically centered, often with a slight dynamic lean or rotational bias that enhances the feeling of movement while maintaining visual stability.
    *   **Padding:** Ensure ample negative space surrounds the core graphic, allowing it to breathe and preventing visual interference. A minimum padding of 25% of the logo's total width/height on all sides is recommended.
    *   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** The primary logo form should occupy approximately 40-60% of the total canvas area, with the remaining area dedicated to negative space. This ratio allows the forms to dominate while emphasizing their interaction with the background.

5.  **Avoid**
    *   Rigid, blocky, or purely rectilinear geometric shapes without curvature.
    *   Flat, two-dimensional, or illustrative rendering styles.
    *   Muted, desaturated, or pastel color palettes; primary colors without gradient depth.
    *   Rough, matte, or non-reflective surface textures.
    *   Overly complex compositions with too many disparate elements or excessive fine details that hinder scalability.
    *   Cartoonish, whimsical, or excessively literal representations.
    *   Explicit outlines around solid forms unless used as a luminous effect.

### For PATTERNS:

1.  **Motif Rules**
    *   **Dominant Motif Types:** Layered curved forms, fluid organic elements, vertical wavy slats, chromatic waves, and swirling layered curves. These motifs should be the primary building blocks.
    *   **Geometric Principles:** Patterns are constructed using repetition and tessellation of these curvilinear motifs. While organic in appearance, an underlying geometric rhythm or grid should be subtly implied for structural coherence. Focus on wave mechanics, radial expansion, or linear progression.
    *   **Motif Dynamics:** Elements should suggest continuous movement, flow, or kinetic energy. Overlapping and interlacing of forms are encouraged to build complexity and depth.

2.  **Emotional & Personality Impact**
    *   **Vibe**: Futuristic, energetic, sophisticated, dynamic, mysterious, high-tech, and elegant. The patterns should evoke a sense of advanced technology, fluid intelligence, and refined complexity.
    *   **Psychological Brand Energy:** Conveys innovation, forward momentum, seamless integration, and a premium aesthetic. It should feel both cutting-edge and timeless, with an inviting yet aspirational quality.

3.  **Grid System**
    *   **Tiling Method:** Seamless repetitive tiling. The pattern should extend infinitely without visible breaks. Utilize offset grids, diagonal repeats, or rotational symmetry for dynamic flow within the repeat unit.
    *   **Spacing:** Elements within the pattern should maintain a consistent, yet dynamically varying, visual rhythm. Spacing between repeated motifs can vary subtly to create optical distortion or depth, but not to the point of disarray.
    *   **Density:** Patterns should exhibit a medium to high density, ensuring that the visual field is rich with detail without feeling cluttered. Approximately 60-80% of the canvas should be occupied by pattern elements, allowing for subtle background gradients or luminosity.

4.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering:** Full 3D rendering with photorealistic or hyper-stylized lighting. Surfaces should be highly reflective, iridescent, or possess a luminous, self-emitting quality. Volumetric effects, such as glowing mists or light streaks, are encouraged.
    *   **Color Usage:** Predominantly uses gradients. This includes monochromatic gradients (e.g., grayscale, dark blue to lighter blue) and multi-color chromatic gradients (e.g., spectrum shifts, iridescent rainbow effects). Dark, deep backgrounds (near black) are preferred, serving as a canvas for luminous elements. Color temperature should lean cool or neutral with strategic warm highlights.
    *   **Complexity:** Patterns should be visually rich and intricate, composed of multiple layers of interaction between forms and light. Complexity should contribute to depth perception and optical interest.

5.  **Tiling Technical**
    *   **Edge Alignment:** Absolutely seamless tiling on all four edges (top, bottom, left, right). There should be no discernable seams or breaks in the pattern's flow when tiled adjacently.
    *   **Seamless Requirements:** All motif elements that touch an edge must continue perfectly onto the opposite edge, maintaining form, gradient, and texture continuity. No abrupt cuts or discontinuities.

6.  **Avoid**
    *   Flat, 2D, or vector-graphic patterns lacking depth and volumetric presence.
    *   Chaotic, unorganized, or random arrangements of elements without an underlying rhythm.
    *   Bright, primary, or overly saturated solid color blocks; pastel or overtly childlike palettes.
    *   Obvious or crude pixelation, low-resolution textures, or compression artifacts.
    *   Static, unengaging compositions that lack implied movement or energy.
    *   Patterns with visible tiling lines or breaks at the repeat boundaries.
    *   Figurative, illustrative, or literal representations of objects.
