### For LOGOS:
#### 1. Form Language
-   **Dominant Shapes:** Logos shall primarily consist of flowing curvilinear forms, amorphous shapes, interconnected loops, and fluid waves. All elements must derive from biomorphic structures, evoking natural processes.
-   **Geometry Rules:** Avoid sharp angles, rigid straight lines, or perfectly geometric constructs (e.g., perfect circles, squares, triangles) unless they are subtly integrated within a larger organic context. Curves must be smooth, continuous, and exhibit dynamic variations in radius, suggesting natural movement and growth.
-   **Construction Principles:** Logos can be constructed from monoline outlines or solid filled organic shapes. The integrity of the organic form is paramount; negative space should be an active, well-defined organic shape, contributing to the overall design. Designs should imply fluid motion or growth.

#### 2. Style Constraints
-   **Rendering Style:** Render logos as flat graphics. Subtle, organic textures such as soft, natural grain or a gentle, volumetric shading (mimicking liquid viscosity or soft material) are permissible if they maintain clarity and scalability.
-   **Fill vs Outline:** Logos can be composed of solid filled organic shapes, consistent-weight monoline outlines, or a combination where outlines define fluid forms encompassing filled areas. Outlines should have smoothly varying stroke weights if not monoline, reflecting natural flow.
-   **Complexity Level:** Logos should be of moderate to low complexity. Focus on distinct, recognizable organic forms that are memorable and impactful, avoiding overly intricate details that reduce legibility.

#### 3. Technical Specs
-   **Stroke Weights:** For outlined logos, maintain a consistent stroke weight (e.g., 2-4% of the logo's shortest bounding box dimension) or exhibit smooth, organic tapering and widening that reflects natural pressure or flow.
-   **Proportions:** Embrace organic proportions that mimic natural growth or fluid dynamics. Avoid strict geometric ratios unless they emerge naturally from the organic form.
-   **Spacing:** Ensure generous internal negative space between elements to maintain visual clarity and separation. Negative space must be intentionally shaped and contribute to the organic aesthetic.
-   **Scalability:** Design elements must retain legibility and visual impact across a wide range of sizes, from small digital icons (e.g., 16x16 pixels) to large-format applications. Simplicity in form is critical for effective scaling.

#### 4. Composition
-   **Centering:** Logos should be optically centered within their designated clear space or bounding box, ensuring visual balance despite inherent asymmetry.
-   **Padding:** A minimum clear space around the logo equivalent to 1x the smallest significant stroke weight or 1/4 of the logo's height/width (whichever results in more space) must be maintained on all sides.
-   **Figure-Ground Ratio:** Aim for a balanced figure-ground relationship where both the primary organic form and the surrounding negative space are equally considered and contribute to the aesthetic without one dominating the other excessively.

#### 5. Avoid (Logos)
-   Sharp, angular intersections, abrupt directional changes, or rigid geometric shapes (e.g., perfect squares, equilateral triangles, sharp zig-zags).
-   Excessive gradients, hard drop shadows, bevels, or photo-realistic textures that compromise scalability and clean reproduction.
-   Strict mirror symmetry (unless the core motif is inherently symmetrical in a fluid context, e.g., a single droplet). Emphasize dynamic asymmetry.
-   Overly complex or chaotic forms that lack clear structure or a discernible organic flow.

### For PATTERNS:

1.  **Motif Rules**
    *   **Dominant Motif Types**: Flowing organic lines, fluid abstract waves, layered curvilinear forms, stylized abstract animal spots, and interconnected organic capsules or blobs. All motifs must be inherently biomorphic and suggest natural, unconstrained movement.
    *   **Geometric Principles**: The underlying geometry is curvilinear. Motifs must consist of continuous, unbroken lines or shapes, avoiding hard edges or sharp corners. Elements should appear to merge, undulate, or flow seamlessly into each other or the background. Asymmetry within individual motif instances is a core characteristic.

2.  **Emotional & Personality Impact**
    *   **Vibe**: Dynamic, fluid, sophisticated, calm, and natural. Conveys continuous motion, natural elegance, and serene complexity. The psychological brand energy is one of adaptability, organic growth, and a refined connection to nature, suitable for both energetic and meditative applications depending on density and color.

3.  **Grid System**
    *   **Tiling Method**: Seamless repetition is mandatory. Patterns can employ an offset grid repeat (e.g., brick, half-drop) for connected, discrete elements, or utilize a free-flowing, non-grid distribution where the continuous nature of the organic forms inherently creates a seamless tessellation.
    *   **Spacing**: Spacing within the pattern can vary from dense, completely filling the canvas with interwoven forms, to featuring significant and deliberate negative space that guides the eye along the organic flow. Negative space is an integral design element.
    *   **Density**: Patterns should range from moderate density, with clear separation between flowing elements, to high density, where forms interlock or overlap to cover the entire surface, creating an immersive, continuous texture.

4.  **Style Constraints**
    *   **Rendering**: Patterns are primarily flat graphic. Acceptable textures are subtle, organic, and natural, such as a delicate marbling effect, soft shadows suggesting minimal volume, or a slight textural quality akin to a natural brush stroke or inked line.
    *   **Color Usage**: Predominantly duo-tone or monochrome, with a strong preference for light backgrounds to enhance clarity. Patterns can utilize up to three distinct colors, where one or two primary colors define the motifs against a complementary background. Colors should be harmonious and ensure distinct separation between elements.
    *   **Complexity**: Maintain moderate complexity. The complexity resides in the fluid interaction and organic flow of forms, not in overly simplistic repetitive geometric patterns or excessively intricate details.

5.  **Tiling Technical**
    *   **Edge Alignment**: All four edges of the pattern tile must align perfectly, ensuring an invisible seam when repeated infinitely. Lines and shapes that intersect a boundary must connect precisely with their counterparts on the opposite boundary.
    *   **Seamless Requirements**: The generated image must be a truly repeatable tile. Any motif or line segment exiting one side of the canvas must re-enter identically on the opposite side. The continuity and integrity of all organic forms across the tile boundaries are non-negotiable.

6.  **Avoid**
    *   Rigid, rectilinear grid structures or perfectly symmetrical layouts that contradict the natural, free-flowing aesthetic.
    *   Sharp, angular intersections, abrupt breaks in lines, or motifs that appear disjointed or cut off at tile edges.
    *   Photorealistic imagery, highly illustrative details, or complex photographic textures.
    *   Aggressive gradients, clashing color combinations, or overly saturated palettes.
    *   Patterns that exhibit visible seams, discontinuities, or imperfect connections when tiled.
    *   Motifs that appear stagnant, static, or lack inherent movement or dynamism.
